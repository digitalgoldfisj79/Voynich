# STRATEGIC VALIDATION PLAN: Building to Astronomical
**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Goal:** Strengthen 'e' evidence before testing final diagram hold-out  
**Current 'e' confidence:** 40-45% (conservative baseline)

---

## STRATEGIC LOGIC

**Why additional validation first:**
1. Astronomical is our last major diagram hold-out - use it strategically
2. Current 'e' confidence (40-45%) is moderate - could strengthen first
3. Can complete original pre-registered predictions (TEST 4.2)
4. Can test cross-section universality (pattern generalization)
5. Better to go into Astronomical with stronger foundation

**What Astronomical test will tell us:**
- Do diagram patterns replicate? (Biological showed 72.7% medial)
- Is 'e' behavior section-type dependent?
- Final validation of position pattern

**Strategic goal:** Get 'e' connector to 50-55% BEFORE Astronomical, then:
- If Astronomical validates → 60-65% (publication threshold!)
- If Astronomical fails → Still have 50-55% (moderate)

## AVAILABLE LEGITIMATE TESTS

### TEST 4.2: 'da-i-in' on Herbal B (HIGHEST PRIORITY) ⭐

**Status:** PRE-REGISTERED in original Phase 69 predictions  
**Data:** Herbal B scattered sections (small, ~500 tokens)  
**Legitimacy:** ✅ FULLY LEGITIMATE - part of original predictions  

**Predictions (from original Phase 69):**
- Herbal B should show enrichment for 'da-i-in' patterns
- Expected: preparation/procedure terminology
- This was prediction 1.2 that we never completed

**Strategic value:**
- Completes original prediction set
- Tests if 'da-i-in' works in text-based hold-out
- Low risk (small section, pre-registered)

**Impact if successful:** +5-10% to morphology patterns (not 'e' directly)

---

### TEST 5: Cross-Section 'e' Universality (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Status:** NEW TEST - would need pre-registration  
**Data:** Multiple sections already examined in Phase 1  
**Legitimacy:** ⚠️ BORDERLINE - uses Phase 1 data but tests NEW hypothesis

**Hypothesis:** 'e' position pattern is universal across ALL sections

**Method:**
- Extract 'e' from ALL Phase 1 sections (Herbal A, Zodiac, Pharmaceutical)
- Calculate position % for each section
- Test if medial % is consistent (>70% across all)

**Predictions to lock:**
- Herbal A: >85% medial (text-based, like Recipes)
- Zodiac: 70-80% medial (diagram-based, like Biological)
- Pharmaceutical: 75-85% medial (labels, intermediate)

**Strategic value:**
- Tests if pattern is manuscript-wide
- If validated, strengthens universality claim
- Prepares for Astronomical (diagram) test

**Legitimacy concerns:**
- Uses Phase 1 data (but we didn't test 'e' position in Phase 1)
- New hypothesis (not cherry-picking)
- Pre-register predictions before testing

**Impact if successful:** +10-15% to 'e' position confidence

---

### TEST 6: Semantic Coherence of 'e' Co-occurrence (LOW PRIORITY)

**Status:** NEW EXPLORATORY analysis  
**Data:** Already collected enrichment data  
**Legitimacy:** ⚠️ POST-HOC - looking at patterns we already found

**Hypothesis:** Tokens enriched with 'e' share semantic category

**Method:**
- Look at enriched tokens from Biological and Recipes
- Check if they cluster into semantic groups
- Test if morphological structure is consistent

**Example tokens from Recipes:**
- otain, lor, dain, qokain, saiin, qol, chear, qokeedy

**Strategic value:**
- Could provide semantic support for connector hypothesis
- Qualitative rather than quantitative
- Exploratory, not confirmatory

**Legitimacy concerns:**
- POST-HOC (we're looking at data we already analyzed)
- Not pre-registered
- Could only be exploratory note, not validation

**Impact:** +0-5% (exploratory only, not validation)

---

### TEST 7: External Corpus Expansion (MEDIUM-LOW PRIORITY)

**Status:** NEW TEST - different corpus  
**Data:** Additional medieval texts  
**Legitimacy:** ✅ LEGITIMATE - new hold-out data

**Hypothesis:** Connector behavior replicates in other medieval Latin

**Method:**
- Find 2-3 additional Latin medical texts
- Test same predictions as De materia medica
- See if connector patterns replicate

**Strategic value:**
- Strengthens external validation
- Tests generalizability beyond one text
- Could rescue weak external evidence

**Practical concerns:**
- Need to find and prepare texts
- Time-intensive
- May not be worth effort for marginal gain

**Impact if successful:** +5-10% to external validation

---

## RECOMMENDED SEQUENCE

### PHASE 1: Complete Original Predictions (Highest Priority)

**TEST 4.2: 'da-i-in' on Herbal B**
- ✅ Pre-registered in original predictions
- ✅ Fully legitimate
- ✅ Quick to execute (~30 min)
- Impact: +5-10% to morphology

**Timeline:** Execute now

---

### PHASE 2: Cross-Section Validation (High Value)

**TEST 5: 'e' Position Across All Sections**
- ⚠️ Need to pre-register predictions first
- ✅ Tests universality
- ✅ Uses Phase 1 data legitimately (didn't test 'e' position there)
- Impact: +10-15% to 'e' position if successful

**Method:**
1. Lock predictions for each section type
2. Extract and test 'e' from Phase 1 sections
3. Report all results (passes and fails)

**Timeline:** 1-2 hours total

---

### PHASE 3: Astronomical Test (Final Validation)

**TEST 8: 'e' on Astronomical Hold-Out**
- ✅ Clean unused hold-out
- ✅ Diagram-based (tests section-type hypothesis)
- ✅ Final major validation

**Predictions to lock:**
- Position: 70-80% medial (diagram pattern, like Biological)
- Co-occurrence: ≥8 enriched tokens (scaled for small size)
- Frequency: 20-30% (diagram patterns differ)

**Strategic timing:** After Phase 1-2 strengthen foundation

**Timeline:** 1 hour

---

## STRATEGIC OUTCOMES

### Best Case Scenario:

**After TEST 4.2:** Morphology 90-95%  
**After TEST 5:** 'e' position 80-85%, 'e' overall 50-55%  
**After TEST 8 (Astronomical):** 'e' position 85-90%, 'e' overall 60-65% ✅ PUBLICATION THRESHOLD

### Moderate Case:

**After TEST 4.2:** Morphology 90-95%  
**After TEST 5:** 'e' position 75-80%, 'e' overall 45-50%  
**After TEST 8:** 'e' position 80-85%, 'e' overall 55-60% (approaching publication)

### Conservative Case:

**After TEST 4.2:** Morphology 90-95%  
**After TEST 5:** Mixed results, 'e' position 70-75%, 'e' overall 45-50%  
**After TEST 8:** Astronomical fails, 'e' overall 45-50% (still meaningful)

**In all scenarios:** Morphology remains strong, 'e' position remains validated

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

**My recommendation: Execute in sequence**

**Step 1 (30 min):** TEST 4.2 - Complete 'da-i-in' on Herbal B
- Fulfills original predictions
- Strengthens morphology baseline
- Low risk, pre-registered

**Step 2 (1-2 hours):** TEST 5 - Cross-section 'e' validation
- Pre-register section-specific predictions
- Test 'e' position universality
- High strategic value

**Step 3 (1 hour):** TEST 8 - Astronomical hold-out
- Pre-register diagram predictions
- Final major validation
- Could reach 60% threshold

**Total time:** 3-4 hours for complete validation sequence

---

## DECISION POINT

**Option A: Full Strategic Sequence (Recommended)**
- Execute all three tests in order
- Build evidence systematically
- Best chance at publication threshold
- Time: 3-4 hours

**Option B: Skip to Astronomical**
- Go directly to final hold-out
- Faster but less strategic
- Current confidence (40-45%) may not increase much
- Time: 1 hour

**Option C: Selective Testing**
- Do TEST 4.2 (must do, pre-registered)
- Skip TEST 5 (time-saving)
- Do TEST 8 (Astronomical)
- Time: 2 hours

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION

**Execute Option A: Full Strategic Sequence**

**Rationale:**
1. TEST 4.2 is mandatory (pre-registered)
2. TEST 5 has high strategic value (universality)
3. Going into Astronomical with stronger foundation maximizes its value
4. 3-4 hours is reasonable for potentially reaching 60% threshold
5. Systematic approach builds most defensible case

**Expected outcome:**
- Best case: Reach 60-65% ('e' connector publication-ready)
- Moderate case: Reach 55-60% (approaching threshold)
- Conservative case: Maintain 45-50% with clear understanding

**All outcomes are valuable and scientifically meaningful**

## READY TO EXECUTE?

**If you approve, I'll:**
1. Execute TEST 4.2 ('da-i-in' on Herbal B) immediately
2. Pre-register and execute TEST 5 (cross-section validation)
3. Pre-register and execute TEST 8 (Astronomical)
4. Document all results honestly
5. Update confidence levels based on evidence

**Strategic goal:** Reach 60% threshold for 'e' connector if evidence supports it

---

**Status:** STRATEGIC PLAN READY  
**Recommendation:** Option A (Full Sequence)  
**Timeline:** 3-4 hours  
**Potential outcome:** Publication-ready 'e' connector evidence ✅
