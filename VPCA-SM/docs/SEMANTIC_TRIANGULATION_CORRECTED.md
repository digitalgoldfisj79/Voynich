# Semantic Triangulation: CORRECTED Summary

**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Analysis:** Top 100 roots from 29,569 tokens  
**Coverage:** 71.7% of manuscript  
**Status:** CORRECTED after critical audit

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTION

**Previous version overclaimed semantic content.**

**Key error:** Jumping from structural categories (VPCA) to specific meanings without evidence.

**This version:** Separates what we KNOW (structure) from what we DON'T KNOW (semantics).

---

## 🎯 WHAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW

### High Confidence Structural Findings (70-75%):

These are based on:
- VPCA independent clustering ✅
- Cross-section behavioral consistency ✅
- Pattern stability ✅
- Large sample sizes ✅

---

### **1. ROOT 'e' - RELATIONAL ELEMENT** ✅

**Occurrences:** 3,159× (10.7% of manuscript)  
**Confidence:** 75% (structural role)

**Evidence:**
- VPCA Field: Modifier/Relation (validated)
- Universal across all 4 sections
- Combines with intensifiers (ch-e-y: 475×)
- Combines with state/process markers (-y, -dy)
- Stable behavioral patterns

**What we CAN say:**
> 'e' functions as a relational/connective element in Voynichese grammar

**What we CANNOT say:**
- Whether it means "and", "of", "with", or "to" specifically
- Exact semantic content
- Translation to English/Latin

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Structural function: 75% ✅
- Specific meaning: <20% ⚠️

**Medieval parallel:** Latin "et/cum/de" (suggestive, not proof)

---

### **2. ROOT 'ol' - QUALITY DESCRIPTOR** ⚠️

**Occurrences:** 1,044×  
**Confidence:** 75% (structural role only)

**Evidence:**
- VPCA Field: Quality/State (validated)
- Universal across all sections
- Enriched in herbal (45.3%)
- Can be intensified (ch-ol: 287×)
- Often appears bare (398×)

**What we CAN say:**
> 'ol' functions as a quality or state descriptor

**What we CANNOT say:**
- ❌ Which specific quality (hot/cold/wet/dry/oily/colored?)
- ❌ "Probably means heat" - NO EVIDENCE
- ❌ "Probably means oil" - NO EVIDENCE
- ❌ Any specific semantic content

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Structural category: 75% ✅
- Specific meaning: <10% ❌

**Why low semantic confidence:**
- VPCA gives CATEGORY, not CONTENT
- Like knowing "it's an adjective" but not which one
- "Red," "hot," "large," "smooth" all fit structurally
- Medieval "-ol-" parallels are cherry-picked, not systematic

**CORRECTED: Previous version incorrectly claimed 60-70% confidence for "heat" meaning. This was unjustified.**

---

### **3. ROOT 'i' - PROCESS MARKER** ✅

**Occurrences:** 684×  
**Confidence:** 70% (structural role)

**Evidence:**
- VPCA Field: Process/Active (validated)
- Universal across all sections
- Highly enriched in herbal (58.6%)
- Strong pattern: da-i-in appears 554× (81% with da-, 99.6% with -in)
- Consistent behavior

**What we CAN say:**
> 'i' functions as a process/action marker, typically nominalized with -in suffix

**What we CANNOT say:**
- Which specific process
- Whether "da-i-in" is a technical term or common pattern
- Exact meaning

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Structural function: 70% ✅
- Fixed pattern "da-i-in": 90% ✅ (it's a fact)
- Specific meaning: <20% ⚠️

**Hypothesis to test:** Is "da-i-in" a preparation/process formula?

---

### **4. ROOT 'ar' - QUALITY/STATE** 

**Occurrences:** 799×  
**Confidence:** 60% (structural role)

**Evidence:**
- VPCA Field: Quality/State
- Universal across all sections
- Enriched in recipes (41.8%)
- Often appears bare (328×)
- Often with transition markers (ot-ar: 111×)

**What we CAN say:**
> 'ar' functions as a quality or state descriptor

**What we CANNOT say:**
- Specific semantic content
- Whether related to medieval "-ar" suffix (agent)

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Structural category: 60% ✅
- Specific meaning: <10% ❌

---

### **5. ROOT 'al' - QUALITY DESCRIPTOR**

**Occurrences:** 735×  
**Confidence:** 60% (structural role)

**Evidence:**
- VPCA Field: Quality/State
- Universal across all sections
- Often with transition markers (ot-al: 100×, ok-al: 125×)

**What we CAN say:**
> 'al' functions as a quality descriptor

**What we CANNOT say:**
- Specific semantic content

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Structural category: 60% ✅
- Specific meaning: <10% ❌

---

### **6. ROOT 'ai' - QUALITY NOMINAL**

**Occurrences:** 887×  
**Confidence:** 65% (structural + pattern)

**Evidence:**
- VPCA Field: Quality/State
- Strong pattern: almost always with -in suffix (99.4%)
- Common patterns: ai-in (420×), ok-ai-in (181×)

**What we CAN say:**
> 'ai' is a quality descriptor that is almost always nominalized with -in

**What we CANNOT say:**
- Specific semantic content

---

## 📊 COVERAGE & CONFIDENCE

**Top 100 roots analyzed:**
- Total coverage: 21,204 tokens (71.7%)
- High confidence (≥70% STRUCTURAL): 7 roots
- Medium confidence (50-70% STRUCTURAL): 9 roots
- Low confidence (<50%): 84 roots

**Important distinction:**
- These confidence scores are for STRUCTURAL ROLE
- NOT for semantic content
- Semantic confidence is much lower (<20% for most)

---

## ✅ VALIDATED FINDINGS

### What Semantic Triangulation Successfully Demonstrated:

1. **Functional vs Content Words** ✅
   - 'e' is functional (high frequency, relational)
   - Content words are less frequent, more varied
   - Can distinguish word classes

2. **Structural Categories** ✅
   - Quality/State descriptors (ol, ar, al, ai)
   - Process/Action markers (i, ot)
   - Relational elements (e, k)
   - Categories are consistent across sections

3. **Pattern Stability** ✅
   - Fixed patterns exist (da-i-in: 554×)
   - Not random combinations
   - Systematic morphology confirmed

4. **Section Distribution** ✅
   - Universal roots present everywhere
   - Section-enriched roots show specialization
   - Content-appropriate variation

5. **Morpheme Behavior** ✅
   - Roots combine consistently with morphemes
   - ch- + Quality roots (intensification)
   - ot- + Process roots (transition)
   - Pattern grammar validated

---

## ❌ WHAT WE STILL DON'T KNOW

### Critical Gaps:

1. **Specific Semantic Content** ❌
   - Don't know which quality 'ol' describes
   - Don't know which process 'i' describes
   - Don't know which relation 'e' describes
   - **Structure ≠ Semantics**

2. **Definitive Translations** ❌
   - Cannot translate tokens
   - Cannot read sentences
   - Cannot assign meanings

3. **Historical Connections** ❌
   - Medieval parallels are suggestive, not proof
   - Cannot prove language origin
   - Cannot prove authorship

4. **Diagram Semantics** ❌
   - Haven't tested label-diagram correspondence
   - Don't know if 'ol' correlates with visual features
   - Need systematic validation

## 🔬 EPISTEMIC FRAMEWORK

### Confidence Levels Explained:

**Structural Confidence (What we measure):**
- Based on: VPCA clustering, distribution patterns, behavioral consistency
- High (70-75%): Strong evidence across multiple independent measures
- Medium (50-70%): Good evidence but some uncertainty
- Low (<50%): Weak or conflicting evidence

**Semantic Confidence (What we want but don't have):**
- Based on: Actual meaning assignments
- Current state: <20% for most roots
- Why so low: No independent semantic validation
- What's needed: Diagram tests, corpus matching, bilingual evidence

**Critical Rule:**
> **Never claim semantic confidence based only on structural evidence**
> 
> VPCA tells us word CLASSES, not word MEANINGS
> Like knowing "adjective" vs "verb" - category ≠ definition

---

## 📋 EXAMPLE: CORRECT vs INCORRECT CLAIMS

### ✅ CORRECT (Conservative, Evidence-Based):

> "The root 'ol' functions as a quality/state descriptor (75% confidence based on VPCA clustering and distributional evidence). It is enriched in herbal sections (45.3%) and frequently appears with intensifier prefixes. We do not currently have sufficient evidence to determine which specific quality it describes."

### ❌ INCORRECT (Overclaimed, Speculative):

> "The root 'ol' probably means 'heat' or 'hot' with 60-70% confidence, based on medieval Latin 'calor' parallels and its use in herbal contexts."

**Why the second is wrong:**
- Jumps from structural category to specific meaning
- Uses weak etymological speculation as evidence
- Assigns high confidence without validation
- Conflates "could be" with "probably is"

---

## 🎯 WHAT SEMANTIC TRIANGULATION ACHIEVED

### Genuine Accomplishments:

1. **Word Class Identification** ✅
   - Can distinguish functional from content words
   - Can identify structural categories
   - Can classify 71.7% of manuscript tokens

2. **Pattern Discovery** ✅
   - Found fixed patterns (da-i-in)
   - Found compositional rules (ch- + Quality)
   - Confirmed systematic grammar

3. **Baseline Establishment** ✅
   - Know which roots to investigate further
   - Have frequency and distribution data
   - Can design targeted tests

4. **Hypothesis Generation** ✅
   - Can propose testable hypotheses
   - Can design validation experiments
   - Can measure confidence appropriately

### What It Did NOT Achieve:

- ❌ Translation
- ❌ Semantic decipherment
- ❌ Definitive meaning assignments
- ❌ Historical validation

**But:** This is still significant progress! We now know HOW to test hypotheses systematically.

## 💡 KEY LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Distinguish Structure from Semantics
- VPCA gives categories, not contents
- Need independent validation for meanings
- Never claim semantic confidence based only on structural evidence

### 2. Medieval Parallels Are Suggestive, Not Proof
- Etymological connections are hypotheses
- Cherry-picking examples is not evidence
- Need systematic corpus comparison

### 3. Confidence Must Match Evidence
- High confidence requires multiple independent measures
- Speculation deserves low confidence
- Always separate "could be" from "probably is"

### 4. Overclaiming Hurts Science
- Better to admit uncertainty
- Design tests to reduce uncertainty
- Update beliefs based on evidence
