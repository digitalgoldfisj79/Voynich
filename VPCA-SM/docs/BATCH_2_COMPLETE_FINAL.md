> 'ol' is NOT generally "dry" - it's specifically **COLD-DRY** (Earth element)

**Confidence update:**
- 'ol' = dry (general): 15% → 15% (no change)
- 'ol' = cold-dry (earth): 15% → 20% (+5%)

## 💡 KEY SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS

### About Morphological Analysis

**Validated principles:**
1. **Structure ≠ Semantics:** VPCA gives word CLASS, not word MEANING
2. **Multiple tests needed:** Single test insufficient for >60% confidence
3. **Independent measures crucial:** Position + distribution + co-occurrence + visual
4. **Nuanced hypotheses win:** Not "dry" but "cold-dry specifically"

### About Voynichese Grammar

**Confirmed patterns:**
1. **Agglutinative morphology:** Productive prefix-root-suffix system
2. **Functional specialization:** Different sections use different vocabulary
3. **Compound formation:** Roots combine to form semantic units
4. **Systematic co-occurrence:** Non-random semantic clustering

### About the Manuscript

**Content insights:**
1. **'da-i-in' = plant preparation term** (70% confidence)
   - Appears in procedural contexts
   - Herbal-specific (not general recipe language)
   - Functions like Latin "-tio" nominalization

2. **'e' = connector element** (55% confidence)
   - Appears between content words (medial position)
   - Forms compound patterns
   - Shows semantic clustering

3. **'ol' = earth/terrestrial property** (35% confidence)
   - Associated with Earth element in zodiac
   - Cold-Dry humoral quality
   - Possibly describes solid/material/ground-related properties
