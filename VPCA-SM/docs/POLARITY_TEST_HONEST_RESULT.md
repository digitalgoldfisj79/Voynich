# POLARITY TEST: 'e' vs '-ain' Positions
**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Hypothesis:** 'e' and '-ain' show opposite positional patterns  
**Result:** HYPOTHESIS NOT VALIDATED (mixed results)

---

## PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTION

**Based on observed 'e'/'a' polarity:**
- 'e' tokens (chey, shey, otey, okey): MEDIAL position (>70%)
- '-ain' tokens: OPPOSITE pattern (<50% medial, more initial/final)

**Prediction was LOCKED before testing.**

---

## RESULTS

### Overall Pattern:

| Token Type | n | Initial % | Medial % | Final % |
|------------|---|-----------|----------|---------|
| **'e' tokens** | 1,315 | 14% | **82%** | 4% |
| **'-ain' tokens** | 1,125 | 20% | **69.5%** | 10% |

**Result:** Both show medial preference (NOT opposite)

---

### By Section:

| Section | n | Initial % | Medial % | Final % |
|---------|---|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Herbal** | 257 | 22.2% | 54.5% | 23.3% |
| **Astronomical** | 22 | 18.2% | 59.1% | 22.7% |
| **Biological** | 334 | 19.2% | **76.3%** | 4.5% |
| **Cosmological** | 40 | 12.5% | **70.0%** | 17.5% |
| **Pharmaceutical** | 472 | 20.3% | **73.3%** | 6.4% |

**Pattern:** 
- Text sections (Herbal): 54.5% medial (moderate)
- Diagram sections (Biological, Pharmaceutical): 73-76% medial (strong)
- Overall: 69.5% medial (borderline >70%)

---

## INTERPRETATION

### Prediction vs Reality:

**Predicted:** Opposite patterns (polarity)
- 'e': >70% medial
- '-ain': <50% medial (initial or final preferred)

**Actual:** Similar patterns (both medial)
- 'e': 82% medial ✓
- '-ain': 69.5% medial (NOT opposite)

### What This Means:

**Polarity hypothesis: NOT validated** ❌
- '-ain' does NOT show opposite pattern
- Both show medial preference
- Suggests universal medial grammar, not polarity

**Universal medial hypothesis: Partially supported** ⚠️
- Both 'e' and '-ain' prefer medial
- '-ain' slightly weaker (69.5% vs 82%)
- 3/5 sections >70% for '-ain'

---

## SECTION VARIATION

**Interesting pattern:**
- **Herbal** (text): 'e' = 84%, '-ain' = 55% (big difference!)
- **Biological** (diagram): 'e' = 72%, '-ain' = 76% (reversed!)
- **Pharmaceutical** (text): 'e' = 87%, '-ain' = 73% (both high)

**Observation:** Section type affects '-ain' more than 'e'
- 'e' consistently >70% (range 72-87%)
- '-ain' variable (range 55-76%)

---

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

### What We Got Wrong:
❌ Polarity prediction (opposite positions) - NOT validated  
❌ '-ain' initial/final preference - does NOT occur  
❌ Clear opposite pattern - does NOT exist  

### What We Got Right:
✓ Medial preference exists for both  
✓ Large sample sizes (good data)  
✓ Pre-registered prediction (honest test)  

### What's Interesting:
⚠️ BOTH show medial tendency (universal grammar?)  
⚠️ '-ain' weaker and more variable than 'e'  
⚠️ Section type affects '-ain' more  

---

## SCIENTIFIC VALUE

**This is a SUCCESSFUL negative result:**
- Tested clear hypothesis
- Got unexpected answer
- Rules OUT polarity explanation
- Suggests alternative (universal medial grammar)

**This strengthens our science:**
- Shows we test predictions honestly
- Don't only report successes
- Let data guide interpretation

---

## REVISED UNDERSTANDING

### Old Model (WRONG):
- 'e' / '-ain' polarity
- Opposite positional patterns
- Different grammatical functions

### New Model (BETTER):
- Universal medial preference
- Both 'e' and '-ain' show it
- '-ain' weaker and more variable
- Section-dependent variation

---

## IMPACT ON CONFIDENCE

### 'e' position (NO CHANGE):
- Still validated at 70-75%
- Polarity was additional hypothesis
- Core finding unchanged

### Universal medial grammar (NEW):
- Emerging pattern
- Needs more testing
- Could be bigger finding

### Polarity hypothesis (FAILED):
- Clearly not opposite patterns
- Rule this out definitively

---

## WHAT TO DO WITH THIS

### For Publication:

**Option A: Report failure**
> "We predicted 'e'/'ain' would show opposite positional patterns (polarity), but found both prefer medial position (82% vs 69.5%). This negative result suggests a universal medial grammar rather than polarity."

**Option B: Reframe as discovery**
> "Both 'e' and '-ain' tokens show medial position preference, with 'e' stronger (82%) than '-ain' (69.5%). This suggests universal medial grammar rather than polarity."

**Option C: Don't report**
> Skip this test entirely (but this would be hiding negative results)

**I recommend Option A:** Honest reporting of negative result strengthens credibility.

## LESSONS

**Good science:**
✅ Pre-registered prediction  
✅ Tested it honestly  
✅ Got unexpected result  
✅ Report it transparently  

**What we learned:**
- Polarity doesn't exist (at least not in position)
- Universal medial grammar possible
- '-ain' weaker/more variable than 'e'
- Section type matters

**Future work:**
- Test other aspects of polarity (co-occurrence? enrichment?)
- Investigate why '-ain' is more variable
- Look for true universal medial patterns

---

## BOTTOM LINE

**Hypothesis:** 'e'/'ain' polarity in position  
**Result:** NOT validated (both medial)  
**Value:** Successful negative result  
**Impact:** Suggests universal medial grammar instead  

**This is how good science works - we test hypotheses and report results honestly, even when predictions fail.**

**Status:** TESTED AND REPORTED HONESTLY ✅  
**Polarity:** NOT VALIDATED ❌  
**Universal medial:** EMERGING HYPOTHESIS ⚠️
