# TEST 5: CROSS-SECTION 'e' POSITION VALIDATION
**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Status:** PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS LOCKED  
**Hypothesis:** 'e' medial position pattern is universal across manuscript sections

---

## RATIONALE

**Why this test is legitimate:**
- Phase 1 analyzed morphology (SM1-SM4) but did NOT test 'e' position specifically
- 'e' was not identified as a pattern until Phase 2
- Testing 'e' on Phase 1 data is therefore a legitimate hold-out test
- Tests universality of validated pattern

**What we've validated so far:**
- Biological (diagram): 72.7% medial ✓
- Recipes (text): 88.0% medial ✓
- External Latin: 88.5% medial ✓

**Question:** Is this pattern universal across ALL manuscript sections?

## SECTIONS TO TEST

### Phase 1 Sections Available:

1. **Herbal A** (f1v-f57r) - Text-based, ~1,466 lines
2. **Zodiac** (f70-f73) - Diagram-based, ~373 lines
3. **Pharmaceutical** (f88r-f102v) - Container labels, ~621 lines

## PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS

### PREDICTION 5.1: HERBAL A POSITION

**Section type:** Text-based (dense continuous text)  
**Similar to:** Recipes (text), Herbal

**Prediction:**
- **'e' medial position: 85-92%**
- Rationale: Text-based sections show high medial (Recipes 88.0%)
- Should replicate text pattern

**Falsification criteria:**
- PASS if: ≥85% medial
- FAIL if: <85% medial

---

### PREDICTION 5.2: ZODIAC POSITION

**Section type:** Diagram-based (circular zodiac symbols with labels)  
**Similar to:** Biological (diagram)

**Prediction:**
- **'e' medial position: 70-80%**
- Rationale: Diagram sections show lower medial (Biological 72.7%)
- Should replicate diagram pattern

**Falsification criteria:**
- PASS if: 70-80% medial
- FAIL if: <70% or >80% medial

---

### PREDICTION 5.3: PHARMACEUTICAL POSITION

**Section type:** Container labels (intermediate between text and diagrams)  
**Similar to:** Neither extreme

**Prediction:**
- **'e' medial position: 75-85%**
- Rationale: Labels are intermediate - shorter than text, longer than diagrams
- Should fall between text (85-92%) and diagram (70-80%) patterns

**Falsification criteria:**
- PASS if: 75-85% medial
- FAIL if: <75% or >85% medial

---

## AGGREGATE PREDICTION

**PREDICTION 5.4: UNIVERSALITY**

**Hypothesis:** All sections show >70% medial position

**Prediction:**
- ALL sections: >70% medial
- Section-type variation: Text > Labels > Diagrams
- Pattern is manuscript-wide

**Falsification criteria:**
- PASS if: All 3 sections show >70% medial
- FAIL if: Any section shows <70% medial

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Strong validation (all 4 predictions pass):**
- Confidence increase: +15%
- Interpretation: Pattern is universal with section-type variation

**Moderate validation (3/4 predictions pass):**
- Confidence increase: +10%
- Interpretation: Pattern generally universal, some exceptions

**Weak validation (2/4 predictions pass):**
- Confidence increase: +5%
- Interpretation: Pattern exists but more variable than expected

**No validation (≤1/4 predictions pass):**
- Confidence increase: 0%
- Interpretation: Pattern is not universal
