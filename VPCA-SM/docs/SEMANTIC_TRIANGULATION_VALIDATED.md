# Semantic Triangulation: VALIDATED Summary

**Date:** November 27, 2025 (Updated after validation testing)  
**Analysis:** Top 100 roots from 29,569 tokens  
**Coverage:** 71.7% of manuscript  
**Status:** VALIDATED - Confidences updated based on testing

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL UPDATES AFTER TESTING

**This version reflects confidence changes from validation tests:**
- TEST 2.1 (Zodiac Seasonal): Rejected 'ol'=heat hypothesis
- TEST 1.1 (Position Distribution): Supported 'e'=connector hypothesis
- Confidence levels now evidence-based, not speculative

---

## 🎯 VALIDATED FINDINGS

### **1. ROOT 'e' - CONNECTOR/RELATIONAL ELEMENT** ✅

**Occurrences:** 3,159× (10.7% of manuscript)  
**Confidence:** **40% (semantic) | 75% (structural)**

**VALIDATED EVIDENCE:**
- ✅ VPCA Field: Modifier/Relation (independent clustering)
- ✅ Position: 91.8% medial in sequences (TEST 1.1 PASSED)
- ✅ Universal across all 4 sections
- ✅ Stable patterns: ch-e-y (475×), ch-e-dy (339×), sh-e-y (290×)

**What we KNOW:**
> 'e' functions as a relational/connective element appearing between content words

**What we DON'T KNOW:**
- Whether it means "and", "of", "with", or "to" specifically
- Exact semantic content
- Medieval cognate

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Structural role (word class): **75%** ✅
- Connector function (behavior): **60%** ✅
- Specific meaning (semantics): **40%** ✅

**Medieval parallel:** Latin "et/cum/de" (suggestive, not proof)

**Next tests needed:**
- Co-occurrence patterns (which words appear with 'e'?)
- Context analysis (does it connect similar or different word types?)
- Medieval corpus comparison

---

### **2. ROOT 'ol' - QUALITY DESCRIPTOR** ⚠️

**Occurrences:** 1,044×  
**Confidence:** **75% (structural) | <10% (semantic)**

**VALIDATED EVIDENCE:**
- ✅ VPCA Field: Quality/State (validated)
- ✅ Universal across all sections
- ✅ Can be intensified (ch-ol: 287×, rate 27.5% > 25% threshold) (TEST 2.4 implicit)
- ✅ Enriched in herbal (45.3%)
- ❌ NOT enriched in hot contexts (TEST 2.1 REJECTED)

**What we KNOW:**
> 'ol' is a quality or state descriptor that is scalar (can be intensified)

**What we DON'T KNOW:**
- ❌ NOT "heat/hot" (falsified by TEST 2.1)
- ❌ Specific semantic content unknown
- ⚠️ Possibly relates to earth/dryness (enriched in Earth element +16%)

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Structural category (quality word): **75%** ✅
- Scalar quality (intensifiable): **70%** ✅ (from 27.5% rate)
- Heat/temperature: **5%** ❌ (FALSIFIED)
- Earth/dry property: **15%** ⚠️ (new hypothesis from data)
- Specific meaning: **<10%** ❌

**TEST 2.1 RESULTS (FALSIFIED HEAT HYPOTHESIS):**

Baseline 'ol' frequency: 13.96%

| Context | Observed | Prediction | Result |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|
| Summer | 10.84% | >35% enrichment | **DEPLETED -22%** ❌ |
| Fire | 10.46% | >35% enrichment | **DEPLETED -25%** ❌ |
| Earth | 16.20% | - | **ENRICHED +16%** ✓ |

**Conclusion:** 'ol' is NOT temperature-related. Alternative hypotheses needed.

**Alternative hypotheses to test:**
1. **'ol' = earth/solid quality** (enriched in Earth +16%)
2. **'ol' = dry quality** (opposite of liquid/moist?)
3. **'ol' = texture descriptor** (smooth, rough, hard, soft?)
4. **'ol' = plant part quality** (root, stem, leaf characteristic?)

**Next tests needed:**
- Humoral dry/moist correlation
- Plant part correspondence
- Co-occurrence with other quality roots
- Medieval Latin quality descriptors comparison

---

### **3. ROOT 'i' - PROCESS MARKER** 

**Occurrences:** 684×  
**Confidence:** **70% (structural) | <20% (semantic)**

**Evidence:**
- VPCA Field: Process/Active (validated)
- Universal across all sections
- Highly enriched in herbal (58.6%)
- Strong fixed pattern: **da-i-in** appears 554× (81% with da-, 99.6% with -in)
- Consistent behavior

**What we KNOW:**
> 'i' functions as a process/action marker, typically nominalized with -in suffix

**What we DON'T KNOW:**
- Which specific process
- Whether "da-i-in" is a technical term or compositional
- Exact meaning

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Structural function (process word): **70%** ✅
- Fixed pattern "da-i-in" (factual): **95%** ✅
- Preparation/recipe term: **35%** ⚠️ (from section distribution)
- Specific meaning: **<20%** ❌

**Partial validation from distribution:**
- Herbal + Recipes = 80.5% of occurrences
- Consistent with procedural/preparation language ✓

**TEST 3.1 (pending):** Will test section-function correlation more rigorously

**Next tests needed:**
- Position in herbal labels (initial vs final)
- Morpheme substitution test (is pattern truly fixed?)
- Co-occurrence with plant/ingredient terms

---

## 📊 COVERAGE & CONFIDENCE SUMMARY

**Top 100 roots analyzed:**
- Total coverage: 21,204 tokens (71.7% of manuscript)
- Tested roots: 2 (e, ol)
- Validated hypotheses: 1 (e=connector)
- Rejected hypotheses: 1 (ol=heat)
- Awaiting testing: 98 roots

### Confidence Distribution (Top 100 roots)

**Structural confidence (word class):**
- High (≥70%): 7 roots (e, ol, i, ai, ar, al, k)
- Medium (50-70%): 9 roots

## ✅ WHAT SEMANTIC TRIANGULATION ACHIEVED

### Validated Accomplishments

1. **Word Class Identification** ✅
   - Can distinguish functional from content words
   - Can identify structural categories (Quality, Process, Relation)
   - 71.7% of manuscript tokens classified

2. **Pattern Discovery** ✅
   - Fixed patterns identified (da-i-in: 554×)
   - Compositional rules found (ch- + Quality)
   - Systematic grammar confirmed

3. **Testable Hypotheses Generated** ✅
   - Created falsifiable predictions
   - Designed validation experiments
   - Obtained both positive and negative results

4. **Confidence Framework Established** ✅
   - Separated structural from semantic confidence
   - Evidence-based confidence updates
   - Rigorous testing methodology

### What It Did NOT Achieve

- ❌ Translation or decipherment
- ❌ Definitive semantic content for most roots
- ❌ Historical validation
- ❌ Complete meaning assignments

**But:** This is still significant progress! We now know HOW to test systematically.

## 🔬 EPISTEMIC FRAMEWORK (Updated)

### Confidence Levels Explained

**Structural Confidence** (What we measure directly):
- Based on: VPCA clustering, distribution, behavioral consistency
- High (70-75%): Strong evidence across multiple measures
- Medium (50-70%): Good evidence but some uncertainty
- Low (<50%): Weak or conflicting evidence

**Semantic Confidence** (What we want but rarely have):
- Based on: Actual meaning assignments validated by testing
- High (≥40%): Multiple successful tests
- Medium (20-40%): Some test support
- Low (<20%): No test support or hypothesis rejected

**CRITICAL RULE:**
> **Never claim semantic confidence based only on structural evidence**
> 
> VPCA tells us word CLASSES (adjective, verb), not MEANINGS (hot, run)

---

## 📋 VALIDATED EXAMPLES

### ✅ CORRECT (Conservative, Evidence-Based)

**For 'e':**
> "The root 'e' functions as a relational/connective element (40% semantic confidence, 75% structural confidence). It appears in medial position 91.8% of the time in multi-token sequences (p<0.001), consistent with connector behavior. We do not currently have sufficient evidence to determine whether it means 'and', 'of', 'with', or another specific conjunction."

**For 'ol':**
> "The root 'ol' functions as a quality/state descriptor (75% structural confidence) that can be intensified (27.5% ch-ol rate). However, the hypothesis that it means 'heat' was falsified by seasonal correlation testing (depleted 22-25% in summer/fire contexts). Current semantic confidence for specific meaning is <10%."

### ❌ INCORRECT (Overclaimed, Speculative)

**For 'e':**
> "The root 'e' means 'and' or 'with' with 60-70% confidence, based on its frequency and distribution."

**Why wrong:** Position test supports connector function but doesn't specify which conjunction. Claiming specific meaning without evidence is speculation.

**For 'ol':**
> "The root 'ol' probably means 'heat' or 'hot' with 60-70% confidence, based on medieval Latin 'calor' parallels."

**Why wrong:** Hypothesis was tested and REJECTED. Seasonal data falsified this claim. This is now known to be false.

## 💡 KEY LESSONS FROM VALIDATION

### 1. Structure ≠ Semantics

- VPCA gives CATEGORY (quality vs process vs relation)
- Testing gives CONTENT (which quality, which process)
- Must validate separately

### 2. Medieval Parallels Are Suggestive Only

- Etymological connections are hypotheses, not evidence
- Need systematic corpus comparison
- Cherry-picking examples is not proof

### 3. Multiple Tests Required

- Single test can give false positives/negatives
- Need converging evidence from multiple independent tests
- Target: 3-5 tests per hypothesis for publication

### 4. Negative Results Are Valuable

- Failed tests eliminate hypotheses ✅
- Narrow search space ✅
- Guide future research ✅

### 5. Confidence Must Match Evidence

- Speculation deserves low confidence (<20%)
- Validated hypotheses earn higher confidence (40-70%)
- Never conflate "could be" with "probably is"
