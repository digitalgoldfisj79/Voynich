## 🎯 NEW HYPOTHESES TO TEST

### HYPOTHESIS A: 'ol' = DRY/DRYNESS

**Rationale:** Earth element enrichment (+16% in TEST 2.1)

**Supporting evidence:**
1. **Humoral theory:** Earth = Cold-Dry traditionally
2. **Element correlation:** Enriched in Earth signs (f68 Taurus 16.0%, f72 Virgo 16.4%)
3. **Herbal context:** Dry vs moist is critical plant property in medieval medicine
4. **Opposite of liquid:** Medieval texts often contrast "dry" (siccus) vs "liquid" (liquidus) properties

**Specific predictions:**

**If 'ol' = dry:**
- Enriched in Cold-Dry signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) >18%
- Enriched in Hot-Dry signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) >15%
- Depleted in moist signs (Water, Air) <12%
- Co-occurs with solid/powder plant parts (roots, seeds) not liquids
- Appears in recipes involving drying/powder preparation

**Medieval cognates:**
- Latin: "siccus" (dry), "aridus" (arid, dry)
- Italian: "secco" (dry)
- Catalan: "sec" (dry)

**Testable via:**
- TEST 2.2: Humoral dry/moist correlation
- TEST 5.1: Plant part correspondence (roots/seeds vs sap/juice)
- TEST 2.3: Co-occurrence with other dry-related roots

**Current confidence:** 15% (from Earth enrichment)  
**Target confidence:** 40-60% (if multiple tests pass)

---

### HYPOTHESIS B: 'ol' = SOLID/MATERIAL

**Rationale:** Earth element + herbal part usage

**Supporting evidence:**
1. **Earth association:** Earth traditionally = solid, material, physical
2. **Plant context:** Could describe solid plant parts (wood, bark, root)
3. **Medieval pharmacy:** Distinguished material substance from essence/spirit
4. **Scalar property:** Can be more/less solid (ch-ol = "very solid"?)

**Specific predictions:**

**If 'ol' = solid/material:**
- Appears more on structural plant parts (stems, bark, wood) than flowers/leaves
- Co-occurs with terms for physical substance
- Used in recipes involving grinding, crushing solid matter
- Less common in zodiac (cosmological) than herbal (physical)

**Medieval cognates:**
- Latin: "solidus" (solid), "corpus" (body, substance)
- Could relate to "materia" (matter, substance)

**Testable via:**
- TEST 5.1: Plant part diagram analysis (solid vs soft parts)
- TEST 2.3: Co-occurrence with preparation verbs (grind, crush vs mix, dissolve)
- Medieval corpus comparison for substance terminology

**Current confidence:** 10%  
**Target confidence:** 30-50%

---

### HYPOTHESIS C: 'ol' = OIL/OILY

**Rationale:** Etymology + medieval pharmacy

**Supporting evidence:**
1. **Medieval cognate:** Latin "oleum" (oil) has "-ol-" phonology
2. **Herbal context:** Oil extraction crucial in medieval medicine
3. **Plant property:** Oily vs watery is important distinction
4. **Scalar property:** Can be more/less oily (ch-ol = "very oily"?)

**BUT CRITICAL PROBLEMS:**
1. ❌ User mentioned earlier work concluded 'ol' ≠ oil/liquid
2. ⚠️ If oil/liquid, should be enriched in Water signs (but depleted -27%)
3. ⚠️ Conflicts with Earth enrichment (+16%)
4. ⚠️ Oil usually associated with hot/moist, not cold/dry

**Verdict:** LIKELY REJECTED, but worth testing systematically

**Specific predictions:**

**If 'ol' = oil/oily:**
- Would be enriched in hot-moist contexts (oils are warm, fluid)
- Would appear with liquid-related terms
- Would be enriched in flower/seed contexts (oil-rich parts)
- Would be depleted in root/bark contexts

**But TEST 2.1 shows:**
- ❌ NOT enriched in hot contexts (-25%)
- ❌ NOT enriched in moist (water) contexts (-27%)
- ✓ Enriched in earth (solid) contexts (+16%)

**Current confidence:** <5% (likely falsified by TEST 2.1 + user's previous work)  
**Status:** Low priority, test only if A & B fail

---

### HYPOTHESIS D: 'ol' = TEXTURE (SMOOTH/ROUGH)

**Rationale:** General tactile quality

**Supporting evidence:**
1. **Quality descriptor:** VPCA confirms it's a quality word
2. **Scalar property:** Texture can be intensified (very smooth, very rough)
3. **Plant property:** Texture important for plant identification
4. **Universal:** Applies to all plant parts

**Specific predictions:**

**If 'ol' = texture:**
- Should appear on all plant part types (universal property)
- Should co-occur with other tactile descriptors
- No clear seasonal/elemental pattern (texture orthogonal to elements)
- May correlate with specific plant families (smooth plants vs rough)

**Challenges:**
- Earth enrichment suggests non-neutral property
- Texture usually doesn't correlate with elements
- Less explanatory power than dry/solid hypotheses

**Medieval cognates:**
- Latin: "laevis" (smooth), "asper" (rough)
- But no clear "-ol-" connection

**Current confidence:** 5%  
**Priority:** Low (test only if more specific hypotheses fail)

---

### HYPOTHESIS E: 'ol' = COLOR (pale/white/light)

**Rationale:** Visual quality descriptor

**Supporting evidence:**
1. **Quality descriptor:** Could be visual rather than tactile/thermal
2. **Medieval Latin:** "albus" (white), possibly related?
3. **Plant property:** Color critical for plant identification
4. **Scalar:** Can be lighter/darker (ch-ol = "very light/pale"?)

**Specific predictions:**

**If 'ol' = color:**
- Should correlate with light-colored plant parts
- May have seasonal variation (lighter colors in spring?)
- Should appear on flowers/leaves more than roots
- No clear elemental prediction

**Challenges:**
- No clear connection to Earth enrichment
- Color words usually not enriched in herbal vs other sections
- Medieval Latin color terms don't have "-ol-" sound

**Current confidence:** <5%  
**Priority:** Very low

---

### HYPOTHESIS F: 'ol' = SIZE/MAGNITUDE

**Rationale:** Scalar quantity descriptor

**Supporting evidence:**
1. **Scalar property:** Can be intensified (ch-ol = "very large/small")
2. **Universal application:** Size applies to all objects
3. **Quality descriptor:** Size is a basic quality

**Specific predictions:**

**If 'ol' = size:**
- Should appear on all plant part types equally
- No seasonal/elemental correlation expected
- Should co-occur with measurement/quantity terms
- Universal across all sections (not herbal-enriched)

**Challenges:**
- Herbal enrichment (45.3%) suggests not universal property
- Earth enrichment suggests specific, not general property
- No clear medieval cognate

**Current confidence:** <5%  
**Priority:** Very low

## 🔬 TESTING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Humoral Dry/Moist Test (TEST 2.2)

**Method:** Analyze 'ol' distribution by humoral dry/moist axis

**If DRY hypothesis passes:**
- Continue with dry-related tests
- Test plant part correspondence (dry parts vs moist parts)
- Test co-occurrence with drying/powder terminology

**If DRY hypothesis fails:**
- Move to SOLID hypothesis
- Test structural vs soft plant parts
- Test material substance language

### Phase 2: Co-occurrence Analysis (TEST 2.3)

**Method:** What roots appear WITH 'ol'?

**Look for:**
- Compound terms (ol-X consistently appearing together)
- Semantic clustering (do co-occurring roots have common meaning?)
- Medieval parallel compounds (does Latin have similar combinations?)

**This should:**
- Narrow semantic field considerably
- Validate or reject specific hypotheses
- Generate new hypotheses if needed

### Phase 3: Diagram Correspondence (TEST 5.1, 5.2)

**Method:** Visual context validation

**For dry hypothesis:**
- Does 'ol' appear on dry-looking plant parts?
- On roots, seeds, bark (dry) vs flowers, leaves (moist)?
- On zodiac earth symbols?

**For solid hypothesis:**
- Does 'ol' appear on structural plant parts?
- On stems, trunks, roots vs delicate parts?

### Phase 4: Medieval Corpus Comparison (TEST 4.1)

**Method:** Find closest Latin/Romance parallels

**Search for:**
- Medieval medical texts using dry/moist terminology
- Herbal texts describing plant properties
- Pharmacy texts describing substance types

**Compare:**
- Frequency patterns
- Co-occurrence patterns
- Morphological behavior

## 📈 CONFIDENCE TARGETS

### After TEST 2.2 (Humoral correlation)

**If dry enrichment found:**
- Hypothesis A: 15% → 35-40%
- Ready for Phase 2 testing

**If no pattern:**
- All hypotheses remain <20%
- Need co-occurrence data to proceed

### After TEST 2.3 (Co-occurrence)

**With clear clustering:**
- Leading hypothesis: 35-40% → 50-60%
- Alternative hypotheses: 5-10% → 20-30%

**Without clear clustering:**
- All remain low (<30%)
- Need visual/diagram evidence

### After TEST 5.1 (Diagram correspondence)

**With visual correlation:**
- Leading hypothesis: 50-60% → 65-75%
- Ready for publication claims

**Without visual correlation:**
- Leading hypothesis: 50-60% → 40-50% (reduced)
- Need more evidence

### Target Final Confidence

**For publication:**
- Need >60% confidence for primary claim
- Need >50% confidence with multiple converging tests
- Need <40% for rejected alternatives

**Conservative publication claim:**
> "'ol' most likely describes a plant property related to dryness or solidity (60-70% confidence based on humoral correlation, co-occurrence patterns, and diagram correspondence). Alternative hypotheses including temperature and liquid properties have been systematically rejected."

## 🔧 METHODOLOGICAL NOTES

### What Makes a Good Alternative Hypothesis

**Requirements:**
1. ✅ Explains existing data (Earth enrichment, herbal use, etc.)
2. ✅ Makes falsifiable predictions
3. ✅ Has medieval parallel (etymology)
4. ✅ Fits with scalar property (intensification)
5. ✅ Applies to plant/substance description

**Dry hypothesis scores:** 5/5 ✅  
**Solid hypothesis scores:** 4/5 ✅  
**Oil hypothesis scores:** 2/5 ❌  
**Others score:** 1-2/5 ❌

### Avoiding Confirmation Bias

**Critical safeguards:**
1. Test ALL plausible hypotheses, not just favorite
2. Design tests that could reject leading hypothesis
3. Update confidence DOWN if tests fail
4. Consider null results seriously
5. Don't "explain away" negative results

**Example:**
If TEST 2.2 shows NO dry enrichment:
- ✅ Hypothesis A confidence goes DOWN (not sideways)
- ✅ Move to next hypothesis
- ❌ Don't adjust predictions to fit data
- ❌ Don't dismiss test as "unclear"

### Statistical Thresholds

**For enrichment claims:**
- >30% above baseline = Strong enrichment (+20% confidence)
- >15% above baseline = Moderate enrichment (+15% confidence)
- >5% above baseline = Weak enrichment (+10% confidence)
- Within ±5% = No pattern (0% confidence change)
- <-15% below baseline = Depletion (-10% confidence)
