# TEST 8: ASTRONOMICAL HOLD-OUT VALIDATION
**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Status:** PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS LOCKED  
**Section:** Astronomical (f58r-f65r) - Star diagrams

---

## RATIONALE

**Why this test matters:**
- Astronomical is final major unused hold-out (~87 lines, ~1,000 tokens)
- Diagram-based section (circular star charts with labels)
- Can validate if 'e' pattern replicates in new hold-out
- Similar structure to Biological but different content

**What we know:**
- 'e' is >70% medial across ALL tested sections (universal)
- Section-type (diagram vs text) does NOT predict medial % (TEST 5 falsified this)
- Biological: 72.7% medial
- Zodiac: 96.0% medial (but small sample, n=25)
- Range: 72-96% for diagram sections

**Conservative approach:**
Given TEST 5 falsified section-type hypothesis, predictions must be broader

## SECTION DESCRIPTION

**Astronomical (f58r-f65r):**
- Type: Diagram-based (circular star charts)
- Content: Star labels around circular diagrams
- Structure: Short labels, similar to zodiac symbols
- Size: ~87 lines total (small section)
- Expected 'e' lines: ~20-40 (based on ~25-40% frequency)

---

## PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS

### PREDICTION 8.1: POSITION (PRIMARY)

**Hypothesis:** 'e' shows medial position preference in Astronomical

**Prediction:**
- **'e' medial position: >70%**
- Rationale: ALL sections show >70% medial (universality validated in TEST 5)
- This is the most robust pattern we have

**Falsification criteria:**
- PASS if: >70% medial
- FAIL if: ≤70% medial

**Confidence: HIGH** (universality validated across 6 sections)

---

### PREDICTION 8.2: ENRICHMENT (SECONDARY)

**Hypothesis:** 'e' shows co-occurrence enrichment pattern

**Prediction:**
- **≥8 enriched tokens (≥1.5x enrichment, ≥5 occurrences)**
- Rationale: Biological showed 21 tokens, Recipes showed 12 tokens
- Scale to small section size (~40% of Recipes CLEAN)
- Conservative threshold: 8 tokens

**Falsification criteria:**
- PASS if: ≥8 enriched tokens
- FAIL if: <8 enriched tokens

**Confidence: MEDIUM** (pattern validated in 2 sections, variable by size)

---

### PREDICTION 8.3: FREQUENCY (TERTIARY)

**Hypothesis:** 'e' appears in 20-40% of lines

**Prediction:**
- **'e' frequency: 20-40% of lines**
- Rationale: Varies by section (16% Herbal B, 41% Recipes, ~30% elsewhere)
- Broad range to account for section variation

**Falsification criteria:**
- PASS if: 20-40% frequency
- FAIL if: <20% or >40%

**Confidence: LOW** (high variation across sections)

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Strong validation (3/3 predictions pass):**
- Confidence increase: +15%
- Interpretation: 'e' pattern robust across all major hold-outs

**Moderate validation (2/3 predictions pass):**
- Confidence increase: +10%
- Interpretation: Core pattern validated, some aspects variable

**Weak validation (1/3 predictions pass):**
- Confidence increase: +5%
- Interpretation: Position pattern holds, other aspects inconsistent

**No validation (0/3 predictions pass):**
- Confidence decrease: -10%
- Interpretation: Pattern does not extend to Astronomical

---

## SAMPLE SIZE CAVEAT

**Expected sample size:** ~20-40 lines with 'e'

**Interpretation guidance:**
- If n < 20: Results tentative, note insufficient data
- If n = 20-50: Results moderately reliable
- If n > 50: Results reliable

**Commit to:**
- Report sample size prominently
- Note if results are underpowered
- Do not overinterpret small-sample findings

---

## COMPARISON FRAMEWORK

**After testing, compare to:**

**Diagram sections:**
- Biological: 72.7% medial (n=152 lines)
- Zodiac: 96.0% medial (n=25 lines, SMALL)
- Astronomical: ??? (n=~30-40 lines)

**Text sections:**
- Herbal A: 81.6% medial (n=190 lines)
- Recipes: 88.0% medial (n=258 lines)

**Expected:** Astronomical should fall in 70-90% range (broad)

---

## REPORTING COMMITMENT

**I commit to:**
1. Report all predictions (no selective)
2. Report actual sample size
3. Note if underpowered (n<20)
4. No post-hoc adjustments
5. Update confidence only per pre-specified criteria
6. Honest interpretation of null results

## LOCKED PREDICTIONS SUMMARY

| Prediction | Target | Pass Criteria | Priority |
|------------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **8.1: Position** | >70% medial | >70% | HIGH |
| **8.2: Enrichment** | ≥8 tokens | ≥8 | MEDIUM |
| **8.3: Frequency** | 20-40% | 20-40% | LOW |

## STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE

**This is our last major hold-out test.**

**If successful:**
- Validates 'e' pattern across 7 independent sections
- Could reach 60% confidence threshold (publication-ready)
- Completes systematic validation framework

**If unsuccessful:**
- Still have universality (>70%) validated in 6 sections
- 'e' position pattern remains meaningful
- Other aspects (enrichment, frequency) more variable

**Either outcome is scientifically valuable.**

**Ready for execution:** YES ✅
