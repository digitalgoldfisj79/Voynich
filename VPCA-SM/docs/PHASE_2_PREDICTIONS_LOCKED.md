# PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS - PHASE 2
**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Time:** [LOCKED AT DOCUMENT CREATION]  
**Status:** PREDICTIONS LOCKED - Cannot be changed after examining test data

---

## CRITICAL: THESE PREDICTIONS ARE LOCKED

**I commit to:**
1. ✅ Testing these exact predictions on hold-out data
2. ✅ Not modifying predictions after seeing results
3. ✅ Reporting all results (including failures)
4. ✅ Using pre-specified success criteria only
5. ✅ Conservative confidence updates

**Any deviations will be clearly marked as post-hoc and confidence reduced**

---

## HYPOTHESIS 1: 'da-i-in' = PREPARATION/PROCESS TERM

### Current Status:
- Phase 1 observation: 80.5% procedural (herbal + recipes)
- Pattern confidence: 90%
- Semantic confidence: 15-20%

### Pre-Registered Predictions for Hold-Out Data:

**PREDICTION 1.1: Biological Section Distribution**
- **Claim:** 'da-i-in' will appear 60-80% in procedural/instructional contexts
- **Rationale:** If preparation term, should appear in process descriptions even in different section
- **Test data:** f75-f86 (Biological section) - NOT YET EXAMINED
- **Success criterion:** 60-80% range met
- **Statistical test:** Chi-square, p<0.05

**PREDICTION 1.2: Herbal B Enrichment**
- **Claim:** 'da-i-in' will show >1.5x enrichment in Herbal B vs baseline
- **Rationale:** Pattern should replicate in reserved herbal pages
- **Test data:** f58-f66 (Herbal B) - minimally examined
- **Success criterion:** Enrichment ratio >1.5x
- **Statistical test:** Chi-square, p<0.05

**PREDICTION 1.3: Position Analysis**
- **Claim:** 'da-i-in' will appear >35% in label-final position
- **Rationale:** Process nominalizations typically appear at label ends (like "-tion" in English)
- **Test data:** All occurrences in Biological section
- **Success criterion:** >35% final position
- **Baseline:** Random expectation ~20-25% (based on label length distribution)
- **Statistical test:** Chi-square vs baseline, p<0.05

### Success Criteria for Hypothesis 1:

| Predictions Met | Confidence Update | Interpretation |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 3 of 3 | +40% (→ 55-60%) | STRONGLY SUPPORTED |
| 2 of 3 | +30% (→ 45-50%) | SUPPORTED |
| 1 of 3 | +15% (→ 30-35%) | WEAK SUPPORT |
| 0 of 3 | -5% (→ 10-15%) | REJECTED |

**Current confidence:** 15-20%  
**Post-validation range:** 10-60%

## HYPOTHESIS 2: 'e' = CONNECTOR ELEMENT

### Current Status:
- Phase 1 observation: 91.8% medial position
- Pattern confidence: 95%
- Semantic confidence: 20-25%

### Pre-Registered Predictions:

**PREDICTION 2.1: Hold-Out Position (Biological)**
- **Claim:** 'e' will appear >85% in medial position in Biological section
- **Rationale:** If connector, positional preference should replicate
- **Test data:** f75-f86 (Biological) - NOT YET EXAMINED
- **Success criterion:** >85% medial
- **Statistical test:** Chi-square vs random expectation (~75%), p<0.05

**PREDICTION 2.2: External Medieval Corpus**
- **Claim:** Latin connectors ("et", "cum", "de") will show >80% medial position in medieval medical texts
- **Rationale:** If 'e' is connector, should behave like known connectors
- **Test data:** Medieval Latin texts (EXTERNAL - never used in Phase 1)
- **Success criterion:** Latin connectors >80% medial
- **Statistical test:** Position distribution analysis
- **Note:** This is EXTERNAL validation - different data source, no data mining concerns

**PREDICTION 2.3: Hold-Out Co-occurrence (Biological)**
- **Claim:** 'e' will show ≥20 tokens with >1.5x co-occurrence enrichment in Biological
- **Rationale:** If connector, should form compounds systematically
- **Test data:** f75-f86 (Biological)
- **Success criterion:** ≥20 enriched tokens
- **Baseline:** Phase 1 showed 40 enriched tokens in full manuscript
- **Statistical test:** Enrichment analysis

### Success Criteria for Hypothesis 2:

| Predictions Met | Confidence Update | Interpretation |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 3 of 3 | +35% (→ 55-60%) | STRONGLY SUPPORTED |
| 2 of 3 | +25% (→ 45-50%) | SUPPORTED |
| 1 of 3 | +15% (→ 35-40%) | WEAK SUPPORT |
| 0 of 3 | -5% (→ 15-20%) | INCONCLUSIVE |

**Current confidence:** 20-25%  
**Post-validation range:** 15-60%

## DEPRIORITIZED: 'ol' EARTH HYPOTHESIS

**Decision:** NOT testing in Phase 2

**Rationale:**
- Phase 1 confidence only 10%
- Likely overfit
- Failed strict Bonferroni correction
- Post-hoc hypothesis adjustments
- Need truly independent test method (diagram correspondence)

**Will revisit only if independent evidence becomes available**

---

## STATISTICAL FRAMEWORK

### Significance Testing:
- **Threshold:** p<0.05 for all tests
- **Bonferroni correction:** p<0.025 (testing 2 hypotheses)
- **Effect size:** Will report for all findings

### Confidence Updates:
- **Based on pre-specified criteria ONLY**
- **No post-hoc adjustments allowed**
- **Conservative default if ambiguous**

### Null Results Protocol:
- **Will be reported fully and honestly**
- **No selective reporting**
- **Failed predictions will reduce confidence**
- **Negative results are valuable**

## EXECUTION ORDER

### Week 1: External Validation (SAFE - Can do first)

**Day 1-2: Medieval Corpus Analysis**
- Compile Latin medical texts (13th-15th century)
- Analyze "et", "cum", "de" position distributions
- Calculate frequencies
- **This is EXTERNAL data - no hold-out concerns**

**Day 3: Analysis**
- Compare to Voynichese 'e'
- Statistical testing
- Document results

### Week 2: Hold-Out Validation (AFTER predictions locked)

**Day 1: Final Prediction Lock**
- Verify predictions clear and locked
- GitHub commit with timestamp
- SHA hash for verification

**Day 2-3: Biological Section Analysis**
- Extract f75-f86 data

## COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY

**I hereby commit to:**

1. ✅ Following these exact predictions
2. ✅ Not modifying after seeing hold-out data
3. ✅ Reporting all results honestly
4. ✅ Publishing null results if predictions fail
5. ✅ Using conservative confidence updates
6. ✅ Acknowledging any deviations explicitly
7. ✅ Making all data and code available

**Any violation of these commitments will be clearly documented and confidence penalties applied**

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES (Realistic)

### Best Case (30% probability):
- Both hypotheses strongly supported
- 'da-i-in' → 55-60%
- 'e' → 55-60%
- Two validated patterns!

### Expected Case (50% probability):
- One supported, one weak/inconclusive
- One pattern → 45-55%
- Clear next steps identified
- Partial validation

### Worst Case (20% probability):
- Both fail validation
- Confidence → 10-15%
- But: Valuable null result
- Learn patterns are spurious

**All outcomes advance knowledge**
