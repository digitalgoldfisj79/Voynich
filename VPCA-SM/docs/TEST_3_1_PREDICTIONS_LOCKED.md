# TEST 3.1: 'e' on Recipes Hold-Out - PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS
**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Status:** PREDICTIONS LOCKED BEFORE EXAMINING RECIPES DATA  
**Test:** Recipes section (f108-f116) hold-out validation for 'e' patterns

---

## CRITICAL: PREDICTIONS LOCKED

**I commit to:**
1. ✅ Testing these exact predictions on Recipes (f108-f116)
2. ✅ Not examining Recipes data before locking predictions
3. ✅ Not modifying predictions after seeing results
4. ✅ Reporting all results (including failures)
5. ✅ Using pre-specified success criteria only

---

## CONTEXT

**This test completes original Phase 2 design:**
- Part of original pre-registered Phase 2 plan
- Recipes is text-based (not diagram-based like Biological)
- Should replicate better than Biological section
- f108-f116 has NOT been examined for 'e' patterns

**Current 'e' confidence:** 35-40%  
**Post-validation range:** 30-65% (depending on results)

---

## PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS

### PREDICTION 3.1-A: Position Distribution

**Claim:** 'e' patterns will appear **>85% in medial position** in Recipes

**Rationale:**
- Phase 1: 'e' showed 91.8% medial across manuscript
- Phase 2 (Biological): 72.7% medial (diagrams, different structure)
- Recipes is TEXT-BASED like Phase 1 herbal
- Should replicate Phase 1 pattern, not Biological

**Test method:**
- Extract all lines from f108-f116 containing 'e' patterns
- Classify position: initial, medial, final
- Calculate % medial

**Success criterion:** >85% medial position

**'e' patterns:** chey, chedy, shey, shedy, otey, otedy, okey, okedy, etc.

---

### PREDICTION 3.1-B: Co-occurrence Enrichment

**Claim:** 'e' will show **≥15 enriched tokens** (>1.5x co-occurrence)

**Rationale:**
- Phase 1: 50 enriched tokens (full manuscript)
- Phase 2 (Biological): 21 enriched tokens (validated ✓)
- Recipes smaller section, so expect proportionally fewer
- But pattern should replicate

**Test method:**
- Compare lines with 'e' vs without 'e'
- Calculate enrichment ratios for all tokens
- Count tokens with >1.5x enrichment
- Require minimum frequency (n≥10)

**Success criterion:** ≥15 enriched tokens

**Expected:** ~15-25 enriched tokens (scaled for section size)

---

### PREDICTION 3.1-C: Frequency Distribution

**Claim:** 'e' will appear in **25-35% of lines** in Recipes

**Rationale:**
- Phase 1: ~30% of lines contained 'e'
- Phase 2 (Biological): Not directly tested
- Standard connector frequency in procedural text
- Recipes are procedural (like herbal instructions)

**Test method:**
- Count total lines in Recipes
- Count lines containing any 'e' pattern
- Calculate percentage

**Success criterion:** 25-35% of lines contain 'e'

**Note:** Slightly wider range than Phase 1 to account for section variation

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (PRE-SPECIFIED)

### Confidence Update for 'e' Connector Hypothesis:

| Predictions Met | Interpretation | Confidence Change | New Confidence |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 3/3 predictions | Strong replication | +20% | → 55-60% |
| 2/3 predictions | Moderate replication | +15% | → 50-55% |
| 1/3 predictions | Weak replication | +5% | → 40-45% |
| 0/3 predictions | No replication | -5% | → 30-35% |

**Current 'e' confidence:** 35-40%  
**Post-TEST 3.1 range:** 30-60%

---

## COMPARISON PROTOCOL (AFTER TESTING)

**After testing all predictions, compare:**

| Metric | Phase 1 | Phase 2 (Bio) | Phase 2 (Recipes) | Consistency? |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Medial %** | 91.8% | 72.7% | [Result] | ? |
| **Enriched tokens** | 50 | 21 | [Result] | ? |
| **Frequency** | ~30% | N/A | [Result] | ? |

**Interpretation:**
- If Recipes matches Phase 1 (text-based): Strong replication ✓
- If Recipes matches Biological (diagram): Pattern is universal ✓
- If Recipes differs from both: Section-specific variation ⚠️

---

## SIGNIFICANCE THRESHOLDS

### Why >85% for position?
- Phase 1 was 91.8%
- Allow 5-7% tolerance for section variation
- Still very high medial preference
- Random baseline ~60-70%

### Why ≥15 for enrichment?
- Phase 1: 50 tokens (full manuscript)
- Phase 2: 21 tokens (Biological, ~8,800 tokens)
- Recipes: ~2,000-3,000 tokens (smaller)
- Scaled expectation: 15-25 tokens
- Minimum 15 shows pattern exists

### Why 25-35% frequency?
- Phase 1 baseline: ~30%
- Allow ±5% for section variation
- Typical connector frequency
- Not too high (>50% would be suspicious)
- Not too low (<20% would suggest different function)

## WHAT WE CANNOT DO (LOCKED)

❌ Adjust predictions after seeing Recipes data  
❌ Change success criteria post-hoc  
❌ Cherry-pick successful comparisons  
❌ Ignore failed predictions  
❌ Add new predictions mid-analysis  
❌ Modify 'e' pattern definitions  

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES (REALISTIC)

### Best Case (40% probability):
- All 3 predictions pass
- Recipes replicates Phase 1 (text-based)
- 'e' → 55-60% confidence
- Strong evidence for connector hypothesis
- Nearly publication threshold (>60%)

### Expected Case (40% probability):
- 2/3 predictions pass
- Recipes shows some replication
- 'e' → 50-55% confidence
- Moderate support
- Clear progress

### Worst Case (20% probability):
- 0-1 predictions pass
- Recipes doesn't replicate
- 'e' → 30-40% (unchanged or slight drop)
- Pattern is highly section-specific
- But: Still valuable null result

**All outcomes are scientifically valuable**

## WHY THIS TEST IS LEGITIMATE

✅ **Proper hold-out:** f108-f116 NOT examined for 'e' patterns  
✅ **Pre-registered:** Predictions locked before testing  
✅ **Falsifiable:** Can fail and decrease confidence  
✅ **Independent:** Different section than Phase 1 or Biological  
✅ **Text-based:** Should replicate better than diagrams  
✅ **Part of original design:** Was in Phase 2 plan from start
