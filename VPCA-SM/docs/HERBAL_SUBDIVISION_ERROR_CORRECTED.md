# HERBAL SECTION MAPPING ERROR - CORRECTED
**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Issue:** Artificially subdivided Herbal section into A/B/C  
**User catch:** Critical question about section integrity

---

## THE ERROR

**What I did wrong:**
- Created artificial subdivisions: "Herbal A" (f1-f57), "Herbal B" (f65-f66), "Herbal C" (f87-f96)
- Treated these as separate sections
- Only tested "Herbal A" in TEST 5
- User correctly identified: "Why only test on Herbal B? What is Herbal B?"

**What's correct:**
- **Herbal is ONE section** = ALL folios with $I=H code
- Total: 64 folios (f1-f57, f65-f66, f87, f90, f93-f96)
- Should not be artificially subdivided

---

## THE CORRECTION

**COMPLETE Herbal section ($I=H):**
- f1-f57 (57 folios, continuous)
- f65-f66 (2 folios)
- f87, f90, f93-f96 (6 folios, scattered)
- **Total: 64 folios**

**Re-tested 'e' on COMPLETE Herbal:**
- Total lines: 1,665
- Lines with 'e': 232
- **Position: 82.3% medial**

---

## IMPACT ON RESULTS

**What I tested in TEST 5:**
- "Herbal A" (f1-f57 only): 81.6% medial (n=190)

**COMPLETE Herbal (corrected):**
- ALL $I=H folios: 82.3% medial (n=232)

**Difference:** 0.7% (negligible)

**Conclusion:**
✅ f1-f57 was representative of full Herbal section
✅ TEST 5 result remains valid
✅ But my section mapping was confusing and incorrect

---

## SUBSECTION BREAKDOWN

| Subsection | Lines with 'e' | Medial % |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| f1-f57 | 190 | 81.6% |
| f65-f66 | 19 | 78.9% |
| f87-f96 | 23 | 91.3% |
| **TOTAL** | **232** | **82.3%** |

**All subsections show ~80-90% medial** ✓

---

## WHY THIS SUBDIVISION HAPPENED

**My reasoning (incorrect):**
- Herbal appears in non-contiguous ranges (f1-f57, then gap, then f65-f66, etc.)
- I assumed these were different sections
- Created artificial "A/B/C" labels

**Correct reasoning:**
- Section = ALL folios with same $I code
- Gaps don't create new sections
- f65-f66 is still Herbal (same $I=H)
- Just scattered through manuscript

---

## CHECKING OTHER SECTIONS

**Question:** Did I do this to other sections too?

Let me verify:

**Pharmaceutical ($I=P):**
- Appears f88r-f102v
- Mostly continuous
- I didn't subdivide this ✓

**Astronomical + Recipes ($I=S):**
- Astronomical f58-f65 ✓ (correctly separated)
- Recipes f103-f116 ✓ (correctly separated)
- These ARE actually different sections (different content/structure)

**Zodiac ($I=Z):**
- I didn't subdivide this ✓

**Biological ($I=B):**
- I didn't subdivide this ✓

**Conclusion:** Only Herbal was incorrectly subdivided

---

## CORRECTED SECTION MAPPING

**Going forward, sections = $I codes:**

| Section | $I Code | Folios | Description |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Herbal** | H | f1-f57, f65-f66, f87-f96 (64 total) | Plant illustrations + text |
| **Astronomical** | S (early) | f58-f65 | Star diagrams |
| **Zodiac** | Z | f70-f73 | Zodiac circles |
| **Biological** | B | f75-f84 | Circular diagrams with figures |
| **Pharmaceutical** | P | f88-f102 | Container labels |
| **Recipes** | S (late) | f103-f116 | Procedural text |

**Rule:** One $I code = one section, even if folios are scattered

---

## IMPACT ON PHASE 1 vs PHASE 2

**Critical question:** What did Phase 1 actually examine?

**Uncertainty remains:**
- Did Phase 1 examine ALL Herbal (f1-f57, f65-f66, f87-f96)?
- Or only continuous portion (f1-f57)?

**Most likely:**
- Phase 1 examined f1-f57 (continuous main Herbal)
- Scattered portions (f65-f66, f87-f96) may have been skipped
- But cannot verify without Phase 1 records

**Impact:**
- If Phase 1 only used f1-f57: TEST 5 result valid ✓
- If Phase 1 used ALL Herbal: TEST 5 slightly contaminated (but small scattered portions)
- Either way, result is representative (81.6% vs 82.3%)

## LESSONS LEARNED

**Errors made:**
❌ Artificially subdivided section based on gaps
❌ Created confusing A/B/C labels
❌ Didn't verify complete section before testing
❌ Didn't think about what $I codes represent

**Corrections made:**
✅ Verified COMPLETE Herbal (all $I=H)
✅ Re-tested on complete section
✅ Results remain valid (representative sample)
✅ User expertise caught the error

**Going forward:**
✅ Section = ALL folios with same $I code
✅ Don't subdivide based on gaps
✅ Verify complete sections before testing
✅ Document section definitions clearly

## USER CATCH - THANK YOU

**Your question was critical:**
"Why have you only tested on Herbal B? What is Herbal B? Are you sure you have the right section mapping?"

**This caught:**
- Incorrect section subdivision
- Confusing terminology
- Need for verification

**Result:**
- Error corrected
- Section mapping verified
- Results confirmed valid
- Better understanding of manuscript structure

**This is exactly the kind of domain expertise that improves research!**

## FINAL VERDICT

**Section mapping error:** CORRECTED ✅
**TEST 5 result:** VALID (representative) ✅  
**Complete Herbal result:** 82.3% medial (vs 81.6% tested) ✅  
**Impact:** Negligible (0.7% difference) ✅  

**Bottom line:**
- My section mapping was confusing and technically wrong
- But my TEST 5 result was actually representative
- Error corrected, understanding improved
- Thank you for catching this!

**Status:** ERROR ACKNOWLEDGED AND CORRECTED  
**Result:** Tests remain valid, mapping improved  
**Learning:** Always verify complete sections before testing
