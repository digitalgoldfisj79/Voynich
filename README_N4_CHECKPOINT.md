# Voynichese Non-Circular Analysis - Clean Workspace

## Current Status

✅ **N1 Complete:** Morphology validated (Phase69 + extensions)
✅ **N2 Complete:** Structural clustering (Slot-Rung + families)
⚠️ **N3 In Progress:** Section specialization (needs reframing)
❌ **N4 Done:** Frozen checkpoint created → `N4_Frozen_Model/`
❌ **N5 TODO:** Hypothesis generation (one-way Latin anchoring)
❌ **N6 TODO:** Out-of-sample validation

## What's Clean (V-Space)

All active phases use only structural features:
- Morphology, position, co-occurrence
- No section-based semantic assignment
- No circular validation

## What's Archived (E-Space)

Moved to `../ATTIC/`:
- Semantic pipeline (s10-s14, s100-s130)
- Contaminated metadata (stem_lexicon with primary_section)
- PhaseS (section-domain assignments)

## Next Steps

1. Reframe section alignment tests (N3)
2. Build one-way hypothesis system (N5)
3. Design out-of-sample validation (N6)

See `N4_Frozen_Model/MANIFEST.md` for complete documentation.
