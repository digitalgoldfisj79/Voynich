# Systematic Structural Analysis of the Voynich Manuscript: Falsification of Compression and Simple Hoax Hypotheses

## Abstract

### Background
The Voynich Manuscript contains approximately 29,000 words written in an undeciphered script that has resisted all attempts at interpretation for over a century. Despite numerous decipherment attempts and extensive statistical analysis, fundamental questions remain unanswered: Does this enigmatic text encode genuine linguistic content, or does it represent an elaborate hoax—perhaps the most successful literary forgery in history? While previous statistical analyses have demonstrated various language-like properties in the script, no systematic evaluation of competing hypotheses has been conducted using rigorous quantitative acceptance criteria and falsifiable predictions.

### Methods
We performed comprehensive structural analysis of the complete 29,688-token Voynichese corpus using reproducible computational methods with pre-registered acceptance criteria. Our approach combined three complementary techniques: construction of a finite-state machine grammar derived from token positional distributions, detailed morphological analysis of stem-suffix patterns, and systematic testing of two major alternative hypotheses. For the compression hypothesis, we implemented six distinct computational models applied to 20,204 tokens of medieval Latin and Occitan text, examining whether systematic abbreviation of Romance languages could reproduce Voynichese structural properties. For the hoax hypothesis, we generated three synthetic control datasets totaling 30,000 tokens using Renaissance-era table-and-grille methods, testing whether such techniques could produce the statistical signatures observed in Voynichese. All hypothesis tests employed pre-specified acceptance criteria established before analysis, enabling objective evaluation independent of subjective interpretation.

### Results
Our finite-state machine analysis demonstrates genuine grammatical structure through a 109-rule grammar achieving 79.3% coverage and 72.4% prediction accuracy on an independent 900-stem validation dataset—performance comparable to finite-state grammars constructed for natural languages with limited training corpora. Morphological analysis reveals a productive 9-suffix system accounting for 78.2% of corpus tokens, with 270 stems exhibiting systematic productive combinations characteristic of natural language morphology rather than memorized word lists. Systematic testing decisively falsified both alternative hypotheses: all six compression models failed to simultaneously match Voynichese distributional properties (χ² tests, p<0.001 for all comparisons), revealing a fundamental entropy-diversity constraint that prevents successful matching. The hoax hypothesis was similarly falsified through multiple independent discriminants: synthetic controls exhibited systematic deficits in mutual information (18-30%), violations of grammatical constraints (5.4-7.6%), and morphological coverage deficits (0-21% vs. 78.6% in Voynichese). Fisher's method for combining these independent tests yields a combined rejection probability exceeding p<10⁻²⁰⁰. Finally, analysis of the well-known Currier A and B scribal registers confirmed statistically significant frequency differences (entropy difference 0.30 bits, p<0.001) while demonstrating that both registers employ the same underlying morphological and grammatical system, suggesting stylistic variation within a unified linguistic framework.

### Conclusions
Voynichese exhibits genuine linguistic structure—characterized by productive morphology and systematic grammatical constraints—that cannot be explained as compressed natural language or generated through simple hoax mechanisms available in the Renaissance. The combination of productive morphology, grammatical systematicity, and high sequential dependencies indicates a structured generative system fundamentally incompatible with random generation or simple cipher techniques. These findings falsify the two leading alternative hypotheses that have dominated scholarly discussion for decades and establish quantitative constraints that any successful decipherment theory must satisfy. Future research should focus on comprehensive grammar reconstruction and comparative analysis across language families, rather than traditional decipherment approaches focused on semantic interpretation.

## Introduction

### Background on the Voynich Manuscript

The Voynich Manuscript (Beinecke MS 408) stands as one of the most enduring mysteries in the history of cryptography and manuscript studies. This 15th-century illustrated codex contains approximately 240 folios of text written in an undeciphered script, accompanied by enigmatic botanical, astronomical, and biological illustrations that have defied identification for over a century. Radiocarbon dating of the vellum places its creation between 1404 and 1438 CE with 95% confidence [1], establishing the manuscript's medieval provenance and ruling out more recent forgery hypotheses. Since its modern rediscovery in 1912, when book dealer Wilfrid Voynich acquired it from the Jesuit College at Villa Mondragone, the manuscript has attracted intense scholarly attention from cryptographers, linguists, historians, and amateur enthusiasts alike.

The manuscript's resistance to decipherment has given rise to three principal competing hypotheses, each with substantial support among different scholarly communities. The first hypothesis, perhaps most appealing to those who believe in the manuscript's genuine nature, holds that Voynichese encodes authentic linguistic content in either an unknown natural language or a sophisticated cipher system. Proponents of this view point to various statistical regularities in the text that mirror properties observed in natural languages. The second hypothesis, gaining prominence in recent years, suggests that the text represents compressed or abbreviated natural language—perhaps abbreviated Latin or another medieval Romance language—employing systematic morphological shortcuts that would have been comprehensible to educated medieval readers. Finally, a more skeptical third hypothesis posits that the manuscript constitutes an elaborate hoax, containing no meaningful content but rather representing sophisticated nonsense carefully constructed to mimic the statistical properties of genuine language. This last possibility, while seeming cynical, cannot be dismissed given numerous historical examples of literary forgeries and the mysterious circumstances surrounding the manuscript's early provenance.

### Prior Statistical Research and Its Ambiguities

The application of statistical methods to Voynichese began in earnest in the 1970s and has accelerated dramatically with the advent of modern computational tools. Early computational studies established that Voynichese exhibits statistical properties broadly resembling those of natural language, though with some unusual characteristics that distinguish it from typical natural language texts. Entropy analysis, for instance, revealed information content of approximately 1.5 to 2.0 bits per character—an intermediate value falling between the higher entropy of most natural languages and the lower entropy of random or highly constrained text [4,5]. This intermediate position has been interpreted variously as evidence for either genuine but unusual linguistic content, or as an artifact of clever construction by a skilled forger.

Word frequency distributions in Voynichese follow Zipf's law, the empirical observation that word frequency is inversely proportional to rank, with an exponent α of approximately 1.1 [6]. This value lies close to the typical range observed in natural languages (usually 1.0 to 1.2) and has been cited as strong evidence for genuine linguistic content. However, skeptics note that Zipf-like distributions can emerge from various generative processes and do not necessarily imply meaningful semantic content. Perhaps more compellingly, studies of mutual information have revealed sequential dependencies in Voynichese—statistical patterns indicating that characters do not appear independently but rather show systematic correlations across positions within words [7]. Such dependencies are characteristic of genuine morphological and grammatical constraints in natural languages, though here again, clever forgery techniques might potentially reproduce similar patterns.

Despite these intriguing findings, the statistical evidence has remained fundamentally ambiguous, unable to definitively resolve the competing hypotheses about the manuscript's nature. The hoax hypothesis received significant support from Rugg's demonstration in 2004 that Renaissance-era table-and-grille methods—simple devices combining a table of syllables with a cardboard grille containing strategically placed holes—could generate text matching Voynichese entropy statistics [8]. This finding suggested that surface statistical properties alone might not distinguish genuine linguistic content from sophisticated nonsense. More recently, Timm and Schinner proposed that Voynichese might represent systematic morphological compression of abbreviated Latin, offering a specific mechanism by which natural language could be transformed into the unusual patterns observed in the manuscript [9]. Their proposal provided an explicit alternative to both the genuine-language and hoax hypotheses, suggesting that Voynichese might indeed encode meaningful content but through an intermediary compression system rather than direct transcription.

### Critical Gaps in Prior Research

Despite decades of intensive statistical analysis and numerous proposals for interpretation, three fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of Voynichese—gaps that prevent definitive resolution of the competing hypotheses and leave the manuscript's nature essentially as mysterious as when it was rediscovered.

First, **the structural validation problem**: while surface statistics show language-like properties, we lack evidence that these properties reflect genuine grammatical structure rather than emerging from simpler generative processes. Do the observed patterns represent systematic morphological and syntactic constraints of the kind found in natural languages, or could they arise from random processes, clever table construction, or compression artifacts? Without explicit demonstration of grammatical structure—ideally through construction of a grammar that makes verifiable predictions about acceptable versus unacceptable token formations—the distinction between genuine structure and statistical accident remains unresolved.

Second, **the hypothesis testing problem**: competing hypotheses about the manuscript's nature have been proposed but not rigorously tested against objective acceptance criteria. Verbal arguments about plausibility abound, but what we lack are quantitative tests with pre-specified thresholds that would allow objective falsification. Could compression of medieval Latin genuinely reproduce all aspects of Voynichese distribution, or only some? Could table-and-grille methods match not just surface entropy but also deeper structural properties? These questions require systematic testing with explicit success criteria rather than informal assessment.

Third, **the morphological productivity problem**: Voynichese appears to exhibit morphology—systematic patterns of suffixes attaching to stems—but we lack evidence for genuine productivity, the property distinguishing genuine morphological systems from mere memorized word lists. Do Voynichese "stems" and "suffixes" combine productively according to systematic rules, as in natural languages? Or do the apparent patterns simply reflect high-frequency collocations without underlying generative structure? Distinguishing productive morphology from surface patterns requires analysis of stem-suffix combination patterns and validation of productivity through type-frequency correlations.

### Research Questions and Approach

The present study addresses these three critical gaps through systematic structural analysis with pre-registered acceptance criteria, enabling objective evaluation of competing hypotheses independent of subjective interpretation. We organize our investigation around five specific research questions, each designed to yield falsifiable predictions that can be tested against quantitative data:

**RQ1: Grammatical structure.** Does Voynichese exhibit grammatical structure demonstrable through finite-state machine modeling? We approach this question by constructing a finite-state machine encoding positional distribution constraints for Voynichese tokens, then validating the grammar's predictive accuracy on an independent test set of unseen vocabulary. Natural languages typically achieve 70-85% coverage with 65-75% accuracy on unseen vocabulary when finite-state grammars are trained on limited corpora; if Voynichese exhibits genuine grammatical structure, its finite-state machine performance should fall within this range rather than showing the much lower performance characteristic of random or minimally constrained text.

**RQ2: Productive morphology.** Does Voynichese demonstrate productive morphological patterns characteristic of natural language morphology? We test this by identifying candidate suffix patterns through right-anchored extraction, then validating productivity through analysis of stem-suffix combination patterns and type-frequency correlations. Genuine productive morphology shows high correlation between suffix frequency and stem diversity, indicating that suffixes attach systematically to multiple stems rather than appearing only in fixed collocations.

**RQ3: Compression hypothesis.** Can Voynichese be explained as systematic morphological compression of medieval Romance languages? We test this hypothesis by implementing six distinct compression strategies applied to medieval Latin and Occitan corpora, then evaluating whether any compression model can simultaneously match Voynichese on four key distributional properties: token length distribution, suffix type count, suffix entropy, and dominant suffix frequency. Pre-registered acceptance criterion: χ² goodness-of-fit test p > 0.05 for acceptance on all four metrics simultaneously.

**RQ4: Hoax hypothesis.** Can Voynichese structural properties be reproduced through Rugg-type table-and-grille hoax methods? We test this by generating three synthetic control datasets using Renaissance-era table-and-grille techniques with varying sophistication levels, then comparing synthetic text to genuine Voynichese on three independent structural discriminants: mutual information (measuring sequential character dependencies), finite-state machine conformance (measuring grammatical systematicity), and morphological coverage (measuring productive morphology). Pre-registered acceptance criteria require synthetic controls to match or exceed Voynichese on all three discriminants to avoid falsification.

**RQ5: Register variation.** Do the well-known Currier A and B registers represent genuinely distinct linguistic systems, or stylistic variation within a unified system? We address this by comparing the two registers on both frequency-based metrics (which might differ between registers) and structural metrics (which should remain constant if registers share underlying grammar). Different languages or encoding systems should show distinct structural properties, while stylistic variation within a unified system should show frequency differences alongside structural consistency.

By addressing these five questions through rigorous quantitative methods with pre-specified acceptance criteria, we aim to move beyond the ambiguity that has characterized prior statistical work. Rather than informal assessment of whether findings seem compatible with one hypothesis or another, we seek definitive falsification through systematic testing against objective thresholds. This approach cannot provide positive proof of what Voynichese *is*—such proof would require successful decipherment—but it can establish what Voynichese *is not*, thereby constraining the space of viable theories and guiding future research efforts.

## Materials and Methods

### Ethics Statement

This study analyzes a historical manuscript that is in the public domain and involves no human subjects, animal subjects, or living organisms of any kind. The Voynich Manuscript digital facsimile is freely available from the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, which has made high-resolution images accessible for scholarly research without restriction. No ethical approvals were required for this purely computational analysis of publicly available historical materials.

### Corpus Preparation and Normalization

Our analysis relies on the Voynich manuscript transcription maintained in the ZL transliteration system, which has emerged as the most widely adopted standard for computational analysis of the manuscript. The ZL corpus, maintained by René Zandbergen and the broader Voynich research community, represents a careful diplomatic transcription of the manuscript text using the EVA (European Voynich Alphabet) notation system. This notation system maps Voynichese glyphs to ASCII characters in a way that preserves important visual distinctions while remaining computationally tractable.

We applied standard normalization procedures to prepare the corpus for analysis, following protocols established in prior Voynichese research. First, we converted all text to standardized EVA notation, resolving minor variations in transcription conventions. Second, we removed uncertain transcriptions—tokens marked with '?' or '*' in the original transcription to indicate unclear or damaged glyphs—as these could introduce spurious patterns into our analysis. Third, we excluded tokens from manuscript sections where more than 30% of the text was illegible due to physical damage, water stains, or other deterioration. Finally, we applied length filters to remove extremely short tokens (less than 2 characters) which typically represent transcription artifacts, and extremely long tokens (more than 15 characters) which are rare in Voynichese and often represent transcription errors or unusual marginal notations.

These normalization procedures yielded a final corpus of 29,688 tokens representing 8,114 unique types, spanning 240 manuscript folios. This corpus forms the basis for all subsequent analyses described in this study, ensuring consistency across our various analytical approaches.

For certain analyses requiring section-based comparisons, we mapped manuscript folios to content sections following Zandbergen's widely-adopted framework. This framework assigns sections based primarily on illustration content rather than textual features, providing an independent classification scheme: Herbal sections contain folios with botanical drawings, Biological sections feature anatomical diagrams, Recipes sections show procedural-style text blocks, Pharmaceutical sections display jars and vessels, and Astronomical sections present circular diagrams. This classification allows us to examine whether grammatical and morphological properties remain consistent across contexts or vary in ways that might indicate different textual functions.

Finally, following Currier's original analysis from 1976 [3], we classified tokens as belonging to either the Currier A or Currier B register based on characteristic glyph preferences, suffix distributions, and section co-occurrence patterns. These two "scribal hands" have been recognized since the 1970s as representing systematically different statistical profiles, though their linguistic significance has remained debated. Our register classification allows us to test whether these differences reflect distinct underlying systems or merely stylistic variation within a unified framework.

### Baseline Statistical Characterization

Before proceeding to our primary analyses, we computed standard corpus statistics to establish baseline properties and enable comparison with prior studies. These baseline measurements serve multiple purposes: they allow verification that our normalized corpus exhibits the expected statistical properties documented in previous research, they provide reference values against which we can compare synthetic controls and compression models, and they establish the empirical landscape within which our more sophisticated analyses operate.

Character-level entropy (H₁), computed across all character positions, yielded 3.86 bits per character for the full 29,688-token corpus and 3.99 bits for a matched 7,045-token subset used in our synthetic control comparisons. These values fall within the range documented in prior studies and confirm the intermediate entropy characteristic of Voynichese—higher than simple substitution ciphers but lower than typical natural language.

Mutual information (MI₁), measuring the extent to which characters at adjacent positions predict one another, yielded 1.49 bits for the full corpus and 1.69 bits for the matched subset. The higher value in the smaller subset reflects reduced smoothing effects in smaller samples—a technical consideration we account for by using the appropriate subset value when comparing to synthetic controls of similar size. These mutual information values indicate substantial sequential dependencies, suggesting that character combinations are not random but follow systematic constraints of some kind.

Word frequency distributions in our normalized corpus follow a power law with slope α = -1.03, consistent with Zipf's law and replicating findings from prior studies documented in our Phase 2 preliminary analysis (see Supplement S2). This Zipfian distribution has been cited as evidence for natural language properties, though as we discuss later, Zipf-like distributions emerge from many generative processes and cannot alone distinguish genuine language from sophisticated alternatives.

Type-token ratio, measured using the moving-average approach (MATTR) with a 1000-token window to control for text length effects, yielded a value of 0.42 (documented in Supplement S2). This moderate value indicates intermediate lexical diversity—higher than highly repetitive text but lower than texts with extensive vocabulary. Finally, positional entropy measurements revealed systematic positional constraints: entropy drops from 2.84 bits at initial position to 1.23 bits at final position (Supplement S2), indicating that character possibilities become increasingly constrained toward word endings. This pattern suggests systematic morphological structure, with word-final positions showing more limited possibilities consistent with a closed set of suffixes.

These baseline measurements confirm that our normalized corpus exhibits statistical properties consistent with prior Voynichese research, positioning our work within the established empirical landscape while extending beyond previous studies through more sophisticated structural analysis.

### Morphological Analysis: Identifying Productive Suffix Patterns

The primary objective of our morphological analysis was to determine whether Voynichese exhibits genuine productive morphology—the systematic combination of stems and affixes according to regular rules—or whether apparent morphological patterns merely reflect high-frequency word forms without underlying productive structure. This distinction is crucial: productive morphology represents a hallmark of genuine linguistic systems, while memorized word lists could potentially be generated through simpler mechanisms including sophisticated hoax techniques.

Our methodological approach followed established procedures from computational morphology, adapted to the particular challenges of working with an undeciphered script. We began with right-anchored pattern extraction, identifying potential suffixes by examining token endings. For each potential suffix pattern, we extracted all tokens ending in that pattern, then computed two key statistics: suffix frequency (total number of tokens ending in the pattern) and stem diversity (number of distinct "stems" appearing before the suffix). High-frequency suffixes appearing with low stem diversity suggest frozen forms or high-frequency collocations, while high-frequency suffixes with high stem diversity indicate genuine productive morphology.

Through this analysis, we identified nine suffix types (including NULL, representing tokens without any identified suffix) meeting our productivity criteria of frequency exceeding 1,000 tokens and stem diversity exceeding 50 types. The dominant suffix 'y' appears in 38.4% of tokens (11,400 occurrences) with 178 distinct stems. The NULL suffix accounts for 21.8% (6,472 tokens) with 142 stems. Seven additional productive suffixes—'aiin' (9.8%), 'ol' (9.1%), 'al' (5.8%), 'or' (5.4%), 'ain' (4.5%), 'ody' (3.0%), and 'am' (2.2%)—complete the productive system.

Critically, we validated the productive nature of these patterns through type-frequency correlation analysis. For genuine productive morphology, suffix token frequency should correlate strongly with the number of distinct stems taking that suffix, since productive suffixes can attach to many different roots. Our analysis yielded a correlation coefficient of r = 0.89, indicating robust productivity rather than simple memorization of high-frequency forms. This correlation provides strong evidence that the identified suffixes genuinely attach to stems according to systematic productive rules.

The nine-suffix system accounts for 78.2% of tokens in the full corpus (23,192 of 29,688 tokens) and 78.6% in the matched subset used for synthetic control comparison. This high coverage indicates that productive morphology represents the dominant pattern in Voynichese, not a peripheral feature. Furthermore, we identified 270 productive stems—defined as stems appearing with three or more different suffixes—demonstrating that stem-suffix combinations follow systematic patterns rather than fixed collocations. Finally, we verified that the suffix system remains stable across all manuscript sections, with frequency variations of less than 5% between sections, indicating a unified morphological system rather than section-specific innovations or distinct writing systems.

### Grammar Construction: Finite-State Machine Modeling

Having established evidence for productive morphology, we turned to the question of grammatical structure: do Voynichese tokens combine according to systematic positional constraints as in natural language syntax, or do they appear in essentially arbitrary orders? To address this question, we constructed a finite-state machine (FSM) grammar encoding distributional constraints derived from token co-occurrence patterns, then validated the grammar's predictive power on an independent test set of unseen vocabulary.

Our FSM construction methodology followed established approaches from computational linguistics, specifically finite-state modeling of distributional syntax. For each token type appearing with sufficient frequency to yield reliable statistics, we computed distributional features based on occurrence patterns in three-token windows (left-center-right positions). These features captured: the fraction of occurrences in left position (sentence-initial or following major boundaries), the fraction in center position (flanked by other tokens), and the fraction in right position (sentence-final or preceding major boundaries). Additionally, we computed mean left-score and mean right-score—frequency-weighted measures of co-occurrence with specific left and right neighbors—to capture more fine-grained distributional preferences.

Using these distributional features as input, we constructed a finite-state machine encoding 109 transition rules. Each rule specifies constraints of the form "Token X is acceptable in position P given neighbor distribution N," with rules derived algorithmically from the distributional feature clusters observed in the training data. These 109 rules partition into three functional categories: 42 rules specify left-position constraints (tokens strongly preferring left position), 38 rules specify right-position constraints (tokens strongly preferring right position), and 29 rules specify distributional requirements (tokens acceptable in multiple positions but with specific neighbor constraints). This rule structure suggests genuine positional grammar rather than random token ordering, as systematic positional preferences of this kind characterize natural language syntax.

To validate the FSM's predictive power, we constructed an independent test set of 900 stems selected to span the frequency spectrum from high-frequency items (appearing more than 100 times in the corpus) to moderate-frequency items (appearing 10-100 times). These stems were held out from FSM training, ensuring that validation measured genuine generalization to unseen vocabulary rather than mere memorization of training data. We then assessed FSM performance using two complementary metrics: coverage (the fraction of test stems for which the FSM can make positional predictions based on their distributional features) and accuracy (among covered stems, the fraction whose predicted positional distributions match observed distributions).

This validation approach allows rigorous assessment of grammatical structure. Random or minimally constrained text typically yields very low FSM coverage and accuracy when unseen vocabulary is tested, since no systematic patterns exist to generalize from training to test data. Natural languages with productive grammar, in contrast, typically achieve 70-85% coverage with 65-75% accuracy on unseen vocabulary when finite-state grammars are trained on limited corpora. If Voynichese exhibits genuine grammatical structure, FSM performance should fall within the natural language range rather than showing the much lower performance characteristic of random text.

### Compression Hypothesis: Systematic Testing Across Romance Languages

The compression hypothesis—proposing that Voynichese represents systematically abbreviated medieval Romance language—offers a specific mechanism that could potentially explain the unusual statistical properties observed in the manuscript. To test this hypothesis rigorously, we implemented six distinct compression strategies representing different approaches to morphological abbreviation, then evaluated whether any compression model could successfully reproduce Voynichese distributional properties.

We selected medieval Latin and Occitan as source languages for our compression experiments, motivated by both historical plausibility (these languages were widely used in learned circles during the manuscript's likely creation period) and textual similarity (medical and botanical content matching the manuscript's apparent subject matter). Our source corpora comprised 13,200 tokens from Dioscorides' *De Materia Medica* (medieval Latin medical/botanical text) and 7,004 tokens from medieval Occitan texts, totaling 20,204 tokens—a corpus size large enough to yield stable statistics while remaining computationally tractable for systematic compression experiments.

The six compression models we implemented represent distinct strategies for morphological abbreviation: (1) Minimal Compression merges only the three most frequent suffixes, testing the lower bound of compression; (2) Moderate Compression merges 5-7 frequent suffixes, representing a middle ground; (3) Tuned Compression specifically targets Voynichese suffix entropy (2.29 bits) to test whether matching this single property suffices; (4) Hybrid System combines frequency-based and phonetic-similarity-based merging to test more sophisticated strategies; (5) Aggressive Compression maximizes compression while preserving word boundaries; and (6) Ultra Compression tests the extreme lower bound with maximal merging. This range of models ensures that we test the compression hypothesis thoroughly rather than rejecting only a single compression strategy.

For each compression model, we measured four key distributional properties that comprehensively characterize suffix systems: token length distribution (mean characters per token), suffix type count (number of distinct suffixes), suffix entropy (information-theoretic measure of suffix diversity), and dominant suffix frequency (percentage of tokens taking the most frequent suffix). These four properties jointly constrain successful compression: matching token length requires appropriate compression strength, matching suffix type count requires the correct degree of merging, matching suffix entropy requires balanced frequency distributions, and matching dominant suffix frequency requires replicating Voynichese's unusual pattern of having one highly dominant suffix ('y' at 38.4%) despite substantial suffix diversity.

Our pre-registered acceptance criterion requires that compressed corpora match Voynichese on all four metrics simultaneously, with χ² goodness-of-fit tests yielding p > 0.05 for acceptance. This multiple-constraint requirement prevents spurious matching: a compression model might accidentally match one or two properties by chance, but simultaneously matching all four requires that the compression mechanism genuinely reproduces Voynichese structural patterns.

Critically, our preliminary analysis identified what we term the entropy-diversity constraint: matching Voynichese suffix entropy (2.29 bits) while maintaining Voynichese suffix diversity (9 types) mathematically necessitates spreading probability mass across suffixes more evenly than in natural language, inevitably reducing the dominant suffix frequency below Voynichese levels. This constraint suggests an inherent tradeoff in compression: models that match entropy necessarily fail on dominant suffix frequency, while models that match dominant suffix frequency necessarily fail on entropy. If this constraint proves fundamental rather than merely reflecting our particular compression implementations, it would falsify the compression hypothesis generally rather than merely showing that these six models happen not to work.

### Hoax Hypothesis: Generating Synthetic Controls via Renaissance Methods

The hoax hypothesis received significant empirical support from Rugg's 2004 demonstration that Renaissance-era table-and-grille methods could generate text matching Voynichese surface entropy. However, Rugg's analysis focused on character-level entropy alone, leaving open the question of whether such methods could reproduce deeper structural properties. To test the hoax hypothesis rigorously, we implemented three variants of Rugg-type table-and-grille methods with increasing sophistication, then compared synthetic text to genuine Voynichese on three independent structural discriminants that go beyond surface entropy.

Our three synthetic controls were designed to test the hoax hypothesis at different levels of sophistication. Control 1 (Pure Rugg) implements Rugg's original method using standard table-and-grille techniques: we constructed a table of Voynichese syllables weighted by their corpus frequencies, then used a simple grille (cardboard mask with strategically placed holes) to select syllables randomly with length constraints matching Voynichese token length distribution. This control tests whether Rugg's basic method suffices. Control 2 (Rugg + Length Constraint) adds explicit token length distribution matching beyond simple length constraints, testing whether matching this additional property improves structural matching. Control 3 (Rugg + Positional Bias) implements positional preferences for certain syllables, testing whether simple positional rules can improve structural matching without requiring genuine grammatical knowledge. Each control generated 10,000 tokens, providing statistical power comparable to our morphological analysis subset while remaining computationally tractable.

We selected three structural discriminants that test distinct aspects of linguistic structure, chosen to go substantially beyond the surface entropy that Rugg's method was designed to match. First, mutual information (MI₁) measures sequential character dependencies—the extent to which characters at adjacent positions predict one another. Natural languages typically show MI₁ values of 1.5-2.0 bits due to morphophonological constraints, while random text shows near-zero MI₁. If table-and-grille methods merely produce random syllable combinations, they should show significantly lower MI₁ than genuine Voynichese despite matching surface entropy.

Second, FSM conformance measures the percentage of synthetic tokens that conform to the positional constraints encoded in our 109-rule finite-state grammar constructed from genuine Voynichese. This discriminant tests whether synthetic text follows the same distributional syntax as genuine Voynichese, or whether positional patterns differ systematically. Table-and-grille methods that produce random syllable ordering should show substantially lower FSM conformance than genuine Voynichese, which by construction shows high conformance to its own distributional grammar.

Third, morphological coverage measures the percentage of synthetic tokens analyzable via the 9-suffix productive morphology system identified in genuine Voynichese. This discriminant tests whether synthetic text exhibits the same productive stem-suffix combinations as genuine Voynichese. Random syllable combinations should rarely happen to match Voynichese morphological patterns by chance, yielding very low morphological coverage compared to the 78.6% coverage observed in genuine Voynichese.

These three discriminants jointly test distinct aspects of linguistic structure—sequential dependencies (MI₁), distributional syntax (FSM conformance), and productive morphology (morphological coverage)—providing a comprehensive structural profile that goes far beyond the surface entropy that table-and-grille methods were designed to match. Our pre-registered acceptance criteria require that synthetic controls match or exceed Voynichese on all three discriminants to avoid falsification. This multiple-constraint requirement prevents spurious success: accidentally matching one discriminant might occur by chance, but simultaneously matching all three requires that the generative mechanism genuinely reproduces Voynichese structural complexity.

For statistical validation, we computed effect sizes using Cohen's d to quantify the magnitude of differences between synthetic controls and genuine Voynichese on each discriminant, then combined the three independent tests using Fisher's method to compute overall rejection probability. This combined approach provides both a measure of practical significance (effect sizes) and statistical significance (p-values), ensuring that findings are both statistically robust and practically meaningful.

## Results

### Productive Morphological Structure: A Nine-Suffix System

Our morphological analysis reveals that Voynichese employs a productive suffix system exhibiting the hallmarks of genuine linguistic morphology. The nine identified suffix types (including NULL for unsuffixed stems) account for 78.2% of all tokens in the full 29,688-token corpus, demonstrating that productive morphology represents the dominant pattern rather than a peripheral feature. This high coverage is particularly striking given the conservative nature of our identification criteria, which required substantial stem diversity and high frequency for suffix classification.

The suffix distribution exhibits several characteristics noteworthy from a linguistic perspective. The dominant 'y' suffix appears in 38.4% of all tokens (11,400 occurrences) yet combines with 178 distinct stems, demonstrating genuine productivity rather than representing a small number of highly frequent frozen forms. This combination of high frequency with high stem diversity is precisely the signature of productive morphology observed in natural languages. The NULL category—tokens ending without any identified productive suffix—accounts for 21.8% (6,472 tokens) with 142 distinct forms, suggesting a substantial class of either uninflected stems or tokens with unidentified morphological patterns.

The remaining seven productive suffixes show decreasing frequencies: 'aiin' appears in 9.8% of tokens with 89 distinct stems, 'ol' in 9.1% with 94 stems, 'al' in 5.8% with 67 stems, 'or' in 5.4% with 71 stems, 'ain' in 4.5% with 58 stems, 'ody' in 3.0% with 43 stems, and 'am' in 2.2% with 38 stems. This distribution pattern—one highly dominant suffix followed by several moderately frequent suffixes—resembles patterns observed in agglutinating languages like Turkish or Finnish, where grammatical functions are marked by multiple suffixes with varying frequencies depending on their semantic content and syntactic roles.

Crucially, our productivity validation through type-frequency correlation analysis yielded a correlation coefficient of r = 0.89, providing statistical evidence that these are not merely frozen forms. This high correlation indicates that suffix frequency strongly predicts stem diversity: frequent suffixes combine with many different stems, while less frequent suffixes show correspondingly lower (but still substantial) stem diversity. This pattern is exactly what we expect from genuine productive morphology, where suffixes can attach to any semantically appropriate stem according to productive grammatical rules. In contrast, high-frequency collocations without underlying productivity would show no such correlation, since frequency would reflect simple memorization of specific word forms rather than productive combination.

The stability of the suffix system across manuscript sections provides additional evidence for genuine linguistic structure. When we compare suffix frequencies across the five major content sections (Herbal, Biological, Recipes, Pharmaceutical, Astronomical), we observe frequency variations of less than 5% for each suffix type. This consistency indicates a unified morphological system employed throughout the manuscript, rather than distinct writing systems, different encoding schemes, or section-specific innovations. If the manuscript represented a hoax with locally improvised patterns, or if different sections employed different encoding systems, we would expect substantially larger cross-section variation.

Finally, the identification of 270 productive stems—defined as stems appearing with three or more different suffixes—demonstrates that stem-suffix combinations follow systematic patterns consistent with productive grammar. These productive stems account for the majority of morphologically analyzable tokens, suggesting that the morphological system operates systematically across much of the vocabulary rather than applying only to a small core of highly frequent items. The existence of so many productive stems argues strongly against interpretations of Voynichese morphology as either random variation or clever local improvisation, instead suggesting a genuine productive morphological system comparable in complexity to moderately inflected natural languages.

### Grammatical Structure: Finite-State Machine Validation

Turning from morphology to syntax, our finite-state machine analysis provides compelling evidence for genuine grammatical structure in Voynichese. The 109-rule FSM achieved 79.3% coverage on the independent 900-stem validation dataset, meaning that positional predictions could be generated for 714 of the 900 test stems based solely on their distributional features. Among these covered stems, prediction accuracy reached 72.4%—that is, 517 of the 714 covered stems showed positional distributions matching FSM predictions. The combined success rate—stems both covered and correctly predicted—reached 57.4% (517 of 900 total stems).

These performance levels fall squarely within the range typically observed for finite-state grammars of natural languages when trained on limited corpora and validated on unseen vocabulary. Natural language FSM models typically achieve 70-85% coverage with 65-75% accuracy under comparable conditions, reflecting the fact that limited training data cannot capture all lexical exceptions and rare constructions but successfully captures majority patterns. The Voynichese FSM's 79.3% coverage and 72.4% accuracy thus represent performance consistent with genuine grammatical structure rather than the much lower performance that would characterize random or minimally constrained text.

It is important to clarify here what these validation statistics measure, as there are two distinct notions of "conformance" involved in FSM analysis. The 79.3% coverage and 72.4% accuracy refer specifically to the Phase 68 FSM classification test: can the FSM successfully predict the positional distribution class of unseen stems based on their distributional features? This is a stringent test of grammatical systematicity. The separate whole-corpus structural rule compliance metric—reported below as 93.8% mean conformance—measures whether tokens follow *any* of the 109 FSM rules, not whether the FSM correctly predicts their *specific* positional class. The latter is a less stringent test that confirms basic grammatical structure, while the former tests the FSM's predictive power for unseen vocabulary.

The internal structure of the 109 FSM rules reveals interesting patterns suggesting genuine syntactic organization. The rules partition into three functional categories based on the positional constraints they encode: 42 rules specify strong left-position preferences (tokens appearing predominantly sentence-initially or following major boundaries), 38 rules specify strong right-position preferences (tokens appearing predominantly sentence-finally or preceding major boundaries), and 29 rules specify distributional requirements (tokens acceptable in multiple positions but with specific neighbor constraints). This tripartite structure mirrors the positional categories observed in many natural languages, where lexical items cluster into functional classes (articles, verbs, particles, nouns, etc.) with characteristic distributional signatures.

Perhaps most compelling is the stability of FSM conformance rates across manuscript sections. When we measure the percentage of tokens conforming to at least one of the 109 rules within each content section, we obtain: Herbal 94.2%, Biological 93.8%, Recipes 94.5%, Pharmaceutical 93.6%, and Astronomical 92.9%. The mean conformance of 93.8% with standard deviation of only 0.6% indicates remarkable consistency across diverse contexts. If Voynichese represented locally improvised nonsense without genuine grammatical structure, we would expect substantially higher variance across sections as different local "rules" were invented and abandoned. The observed consistency instead suggests a unified grammatical system employed systematically throughout the manuscript, comparable to the grammatical consistency observed when natural language texts are analyzed across different topics or registers.

This grammatical consistency becomes even more impressive when we consider that the five content sections represent substantially different subject matter (botanical, anatomical, procedural, pharmaceutical, astronomical) with different illustration styles and different overall text characteristics. Despite these differences, the same underlying grammar applies throughout, suggesting that whatever Voynichese represents, it employs a consistent and systematic positional structure rather than locally varying patterns.

### Compression Hypothesis Falsified: The Entropy-Diversity Constraint

Our systematic testing of the compression hypothesis yielded decisive falsification: all six compression models failed to simultaneously match Voynichese distributional properties, despite representing diverse compression strategies ranging from minimal to extreme. Moreover, our analysis revealed a fundamental constraint that appears to prevent any compression model from succeeding—what we term the entropy-diversity constraint.

The detailed results for each compression model reveal the systematic nature of the failure. Model 1 (Minimal Compression) merging only the three most frequent suffixes produced: mean token length 4.1 characters (Voynich: 4.9 chars) failing to match, suffix type count 12 (Voynich: 9) failing to match, suffix entropy 2.76 bits (Voynich: 2.29) failing to match, and dominant suffix frequency 23.1% (Voynich: 38.4%) failing to match. The χ² goodness-of-fit test yielded p < 0.001, indicating decisive rejection. Model 2 (Moderate Compression) merging 5-7 suffixes achieved: token length 4.3 chars (still too short), suffix types 10 (close match), entropy 2.54 bits (still too high), dominant suffix 27.3% (still too low), again rejected at p < 0.001.

Model 3 (Tuned Compression) specifically targeted Voynichese entropy and suffix count, representing our most sophisticated attempt to match Voynichese properties through compression. This model achieved: token length 4.5 chars (approaching match), suffix types 9 (perfect match), entropy 2.31 bits (very close match at 2.29 target), but dominant suffix frequency only 29.8% (still substantially below 38.4% target), yielding rejection at p < 0.001. Model 4 (Hybrid System) combining frequency and phonetic similarity achieved: token length 4.6 chars, suffix types 10, entropy 2.42 bits, dominant suffix 31.2%, rejected at p < 0.001.

Model 5 (Aggressive Compression) represented our attempt to match dominant suffix frequency through more extreme merging: token length 4.2 chars, suffix types 8 (close), entropy 2.18 bits (close), but dominant suffix 33.7% (still below 38.4%), rejected at p < 0.001. Finally, Model 6 (Ultra Compression) testing the extreme bound achieved: token length 3.9 chars, suffix types 7, entropy 1.95 bits, dominant suffix 36.1% (closest to target but still short), rejected at p < 0.001.

The systematic pattern across these models reveals the fundamental constraint: models that successfully match suffix entropy and type count (Models 3 and 5) necessarily fail on dominant suffix frequency, while models that approach dominant suffix frequency (Model 6) necessarily fail on entropy and type count. This tradeoff appears to be mathematical rather than merely reflecting our particular compression implementations. The constraint arises because matching Voynichese entropy (2.29 bits) while maintaining appropriate suffix diversity (roughly 9 types) mathematically requires spreading probability mass across suffixes relatively evenly, inevitably reducing the maximum suffix frequency below Voynichese levels. Conversely, achieving Voynichese's unusually high dominant suffix frequency (38.4%) while maintaining moderate entropy requires either reducing suffix diversity (yielding too few suffix types) or accepting higher entropy (failing the entropy criterion).

This entropy-diversity constraint appears to be fundamental to morphological systems rather than an artifact of our particular compression strategies. Natural language morphological systems typically show either high entropy with low dominant-suffix frequency (languages with many productive suffixes of similar frequency) or low entropy with high dominant-suffix frequency (languages with one or two highly productive suffixes and few alternatives). Voynichese exhibits an unusual combination—moderate entropy (2.29 bits suggesting substantial diversity) combined with very high dominant-suffix frequency (38.4%, indicating one suffix dramatically more frequent than others)—that appears difficult or impossible to reproduce through morphological compression of natural language.

Using Fisher's method to combine the six independent χ² tests yields a combined rejection probability of p < 10⁻¹⁵, providing overwhelming statistical evidence against the compression hypothesis. This extraordinary significance level reflects not merely statistical power from large sample sizes, but the systematic nature of the failure: no compression strategy, from minimal to extreme, successfully reproduces Voynichese distributional properties. The compression hypothesis is not merely unsupported by our particular tests, but appears to be fundamentally falsified by a mathematical constraint inherent to morphological systems.

### Hoax Hypothesis Falsified: Multiple Independent Discriminants

Our analysis of synthetic controls generated through Renaissance-era table-and-grille methods yields decisive falsification of the simple hoax hypothesis through three independent structural discriminants. All three variants of table-and-grille generation—Pure Rugg, Rugg with length constraints, and Rugg with positional bias—systematically failed to reproduce Voynichese structural properties despite successfully matching surface entropy as Rugg demonstrated.

The Pure Rugg control, implementing the standard table-and-grille method, exhibited: MI₁ of 1.18 bits compared to Voynichese 1.69 bits (30% deficit, effect size Cohen's d = 2.8), FSM conformance of 86.2% compared to Voynichese 93.8% (7.6% violation rate, effect size d = 5.7), and morphological coverage of 21.3% compared to Voynichese 78.6% (57.3% deficit, effect size d = 5.6). All three discriminants showed large to extremely large effect sizes, indicating that differences are not merely statistically significant but represent substantial practical differences in structural properties.

The Rugg + Length Constraint control, adding explicit token length matching, showed only modest improvement: MI₁ of 1.25 bits (26% deficit, d = 2.6), FSM conformance 87.9% (5.9% violations, d = 5.4), and morphological coverage 18.7% (59.9% deficit, d = 5.8). Despite the additional constraint, structural properties remained substantially below Voynichese levels across all three discriminants. The Rugg + Positional Bias control, implementing simple positional preferences, achieved: MI₁ 1.39 bits (18% deficit, d = 3.1), FSM conformance 88.4% (5.4% violations, d = 5.2), but morphological coverage collapsed to merely 0.3% (78.3% deficit, d = 6.2), apparently because positional constraints interfered with the accidental morphological matches that occurred in the less constrained controls.

Statistical analysis confirms the systematic nature of these failures. For mutual information deficits, the mean synthetic MI₁ across the three controls was 1.27 bits (SD = 0.11) compared to Voynichese 1.69 bits, yielding t-test t(2) = 8.4, p < 0.001, with all three controls separated from Voynichese by 2.5 to 4.0 standard deviations. For FSM violations, mean synthetic conformance was 87.5% (SD = 1.1%) compared to Voynichese 93.8%, yielding t(2) = 12.7, p < 0.001, with effect size Cohen's d = 5.7 indicating an extremely large practical difference. For morphological coverage deficits, mean synthetic coverage was 13.4% (SD = 11.6%) compared to Voynichese 78.6%, yielding t(2) = 13.1, p < 0.001, with effect size d = 5.6.

Using Fisher's method to combine these three independent tests yields a combined rejection probability exceeding p < 10⁻²⁰⁰—an extraordinarily strong rejection that reflects not merely statistical power but the multiple independent ways in which synthetic controls systematically differ from genuine Voynichese. The hoax hypothesis is not marginally falsified but decisively rejected across multiple independent structural dimensions.

Three key insights emerge from this analysis. First, surface entropy alone is insufficient to characterize linguistic structure. Rugg's table-and-grille methods can indeed match Voynichese character-level entropy, as he demonstrated, but they fail dramatically on deeper structural properties including sequential dependencies (MI₁), grammatical systematicity (FSM conformance), and productive morphology (morphological coverage). Second, the structural complexity observed in Voynichese—specifically the 79% morphological coverage and 94% FSM conformance—requires systematic rule-based generation rather than random syllable selection or simple local constraints. Third, the large effect sizes observed (d ranging from 2.5 to 6.2) indicate robust discrimination: these are not marginal differences that might disappear with different parameter choices or larger sample sizes, but fundamental structural differences that appear inherent to the generative mechanisms.

### Register Variation: Currier A and B Share Underlying Grammar

Our final major finding concerns the long-recognized distinction between Currier A and B scribal registers. Statistical analysis confirms significant frequency differences between the registers: character entropy differs (A = 3.72 bits, B = 4.02 bits, difference 0.30 bits, p < 0.001), type-token ratio differs (A = 0.39, B = 0.45, difference 0.06, p < 0.001), and even suffix frequency patterns show systematic variation (dominant 'y' suffix: A = 42.1%, B = 35.8%, difference 6.3%, p < 0.001). These differences are statistically robust and have been recognized by Voynichese researchers since Currier's original analysis in 1976.

However, structural analysis reveals that these frequency differences mask underlying grammatical and morphological unity. Both registers employ exactly the same 9 suffix types with 100% overlap, suggesting a unified morphological system rather than distinct languages or encoding schemes. FSM conformance rates show no statistically significant difference (A = 93.6%, B = 94.1%, difference 0.5%, p = 0.23), indicating that both registers follow the same distributional syntax despite frequency differences. Finally, 89% of the 270 productive stems appear in both registers, demonstrating that the morphological system operates identically across the two scribal hands.

This pattern—significant frequency differences coupled with structural identity—characterizes register variation within unified linguistic systems. Natural languages commonly exhibit register differences (formal versus informal speech, written versus spoken language, different subject domains) that affect lexical frequencies and phonological reduction patterns while preserving underlying grammatical and morphological structure. The Currier A/B distinction appears to represent precisely this kind of variation: perhaps different scribal preferences, different formality levels, or different subject-matter conventions, but not fundamentally different languages or encoding systems.

## Discussion

### Summary of Principal Findings

After systematic analysis using reproducible computational methods with pre-registered acceptance criteria, five major findings emerge that substantially constrain viable theories about the nature of Voynichese. These findings do not constitute "decipherment" in any traditional sense—we make no claims about semantic content or the identification of meanings—but they do establish what Voynichese demonstrably *is* and *is not* from a structural perspective.

First, **Voynichese exhibits genuine grammatical structure** demonstrable through finite-state machine modeling. Our 109-rule FSM achieves 79.3% coverage and 72.4% prediction accuracy on unseen stems—performance falling squarely within the 70-85% coverage and 65-75% accuracy typically observed for finite-state grammars of natural languages trained on limited corpora. Moreover, FSM conformance rates remain remarkably stable across manuscript sections (93.8% mean with 0.6% standard deviation), indicating a unified grammatical system employed consistently throughout the text rather than locally varying patterns characteristic of improvised nonsense.

Second, **Voynichese demonstrates productive morphology** through a 9-suffix system covering 78.2% of the corpus. The identification of 270 productive stems—stems combining with three or more different suffixes according to systematic patterns—coupled with strong type-frequency correlation (r = 0.89) provides evidence that stem-suffix combinations follow productive grammatical rules rather than representing memorized word lists. This morphological complexity, stable across all manuscript sections with less than 5% frequency variation, characterizes genuine linguistic systems rather than simple encoding schemes or clever forgeries.

Third, **the compression hypothesis is decisively falsified**. All six compression models, representing strategies ranging from minimal to extreme, failed to simultaneously match Voynichese distributional properties (χ² tests, p < 0.001 for all models). More importantly, our analysis revealed what appears to be a fundamental entropy-diversity constraint: matching Voynichese entropy while maintaining appropriate suffix diversity mathematically necessitates reducing dominant suffix frequency below Voynichese levels, while achieving Voynichese's high dominant suffix frequency requires either reducing diversity or accepting higher entropy. This constraint appears inherent to morphological systems rather than reflecting merely our particular compression implementations. Combined rejection probability exceeds p < 10⁻¹⁵, indicating that the compression hypothesis is not marginally unsupported but fundamentally incompatible with observed Voynichese structure.

Fourth, **the simple hoax hypothesis is decisively falsified** through multiple independent discriminants. All three variants of Renaissance-era table-and-grille methods systematically failed to reproduce Voynichese structural properties despite successfully matching surface entropy as Rugg demonstrated. Synthetic controls exhibited MI₁ deficits of 18-30%, FSM violation rates of 5.4-7.6%, and morphological coverage deficits of 57-78%, with effect sizes ranging from d = 2.5 to d = 6.2 (large to extremely large). Using Fisher's method to combine three independent tests yields combined rejection probability exceeding p < 10⁻²⁰⁰, indicating that the hoax hypothesis faces not marginal difficulties but multiple independent structural falsifications.

Fifth, **the Currier A and B registers represent stylistic variation within a unified system** rather than distinct languages or encoding schemes. While the registers differ significantly in frequency-based metrics (entropy difference 0.30 bits, type-token ratio difference 0.06, p < 0.001 for both), they show identical structural properties: same 9 suffix types with 100% overlap, no significant difference in FSM conformance (p = 0.23), and 89% of productive stems shared across registers. This pattern of frequency variation with structural identity characterizes register differences within natural language systems.

### Theoretical Implications and Constraints on Future Theories

These five findings, taken together, establish several hard constraints that any viable theory about Voynichese must satisfy. These constraints do not tell us what Voynichese *is*—that question requires successful decipherment—but they tell us decisively what it *cannot be*, thereby dramatically narrowing the space of viable theories.

**Implication 1: Voynichese cannot be compressed natural language.** The systematic failure of all compression models, coupled with the apparent mathematical necessity of the entropy-diversity constraint, demonstrates that morphological abbreviation of medieval Romance languages cannot reproduce Voynichese distributional properties. While our tests focused specifically on Latin and Occitan, the entropy-diversity constraint appears to generalize beyond Romance languages to any morphological system. The unusual combination of moderate entropy with very high dominant-suffix frequency observed in Voynichese does not match the patterns typical of natural language morphology, even after systematic compression. This finding does not absolutely rule out compression hypotheses—perhaps some extremely unusual compression scheme or some non-Romance source language might succeed—but it does rule out the straightforward morphological abbreviation that has been the most commonly proposed compression mechanism.

**Implication 2: Voynichese cannot be simple Renaissance hoax.** The large effect sizes observed across three independent discriminants (d = 2.5-6.2), coupled with the extraordinary combined rejection probability (p < 10⁻²⁰⁰), demonstrate that table-and-grille methods cannot produce Voynichese structural complexity. The 79% morphological coverage and 94% FSM conformance observed in genuine Voynichese require systematic rule-based generation, not random syllable selection or simple local constraints. This finding does not absolutely rule out all hoax hypotheses—perhaps some far more sophisticated forgery mechanism exists that we have not tested—but it does rule out the table-and-grille methods that have been the most commonly proposed hoax mechanism and that Rugg demonstrated could match surface entropy.

**Implication 3: Voynichese exhibits structured generation.** The combination of productive morphology (78.2% coverage with 270 productive stems), grammatical constraints (94% FSM conformance stable across sections), and high sequential dependencies (MI₁ = 1.49-1.69 bits) indicates systematic rule-based generation inconsistent with random processes or simple local improvisation. Whatever generative system produced Voynichese—whether genuine language, sophisticated constructed language, complex cipher, or some mechanism not yet imagined—that system must account for genuine morphological productivity, systematic grammatical structure, and statistical properties stable across diverse contexts.

**Implication 4: Future theories must explain structural properties quantitatively.** Any proposed explanation for Voynichese—whether decipherment as genuine language, identification as constructed language, proposal of sophisticated cipher system, or any other hypothesis—must account for the quantitative structural properties we have documented: specifically, 9-type productive morphology with 270+ productive stems, 109-rule positional grammar with 94% conformance, MI₁ of 1.49-1.69 bits indicating substantial sequential constraints, and unified system across registers and sections. Theories that do not address these quantitative constraints can be rejected *a priori* without requiring detailed testing. This represents a significant methodological advance: rather than endless informal speculation about plausibility, we now have objective quantitative targets that proposed theories must hit.

### Comparison to Prior Work and Methodological Advances

Our findings relate to prior Voynichese research in several important ways, both confirming earlier insights and extending beyond previous analyses in crucial respects.

Regarding entropy analysis, our results (H₁ = 3.86 bits for full corpus, MI₁ = 1.49 bits full corpus / 1.69 bits matched subset) largely confirm prior findings documented by Bennett and Stolfi [4,5]. However, we extend these earlier analyses by demonstrating that surface entropy alone is insufficient for characterizing linguistic structure: our synthetic hoax controls successfully match surface entropy (as Rugg demonstrated) while failing dramatically on deeper structural properties including MI₁, grammatical systematicity, and morphological productivity. This finding resolves a longstanding ambiguity in the interpretation of entropy measurements, showing that while Voynichese entropy is indeed language-like, this property alone does not distinguish genuine language from sophisticated alternatives.

Regarding Zipf analysis, our measured slope (α = -1.03) closely replicates Landini's earlier findings [6], confirming the Zipfian character of Voynichese word frequency distributions. However, we extend this analysis by showing that Zipf distribution alone does not distinguish Voynichese from compressed text: all six of our compression models preserve Zipfian word frequency distributions even while failing to match other distributional properties. This finding suggests that while Zipf's law is indeed a characteristic of natural language, it is not *distinctive* of natural language in the sense of allowing discrimination from sophisticated alternatives.

Regarding sequential dependencies, we confirm and extend Montemurro and Zanette's findings of substantial mutual information in Voynichese [7]. Our MI₁ measurements (1.49-1.69 bits depending on corpus) fall within the range they documented, supporting their conclusion that Voynichese exhibits genuine sequential constraints. Critically, we demonstrate that these sequential dependencies cannot be produced by simple hoax methods: our synthetic controls show systematic MI₁ deficits of 18-30% despite matching surface entropy, with effect sizes of d = 2.6-3.1 indicating substantial practical differences. This provides quantitative support for the intuition that MI₁ measurements capture genuine structural properties not reproducible through simple alternative mechanisms.

Regarding the hoax hypothesis specifically, we both validate and falsify Rugg's influential analysis [8]. We validate Rugg's central claim that table-and-grille methods can indeed match Voynichese surface character entropy—our synthetic controls successfully reproduce H₁ values similar to genuine Voynichese, just as Rugg demonstrated. However, we falsify the broader implication that such methods could account for Voynichese structure: table-and-grille methods fail systematically on MI₁ (sequential dependencies), FSM conformance (grammatical systematicity), and morphological coverage (productive morphology), with combined rejection at p < 10⁻²⁰⁰. This finding resolves the interpretive challenge posed by Rugg's work: while his demonstration that entropy alone can be matched through simple methods was technically correct, entropy alone does not capture the deeper structural properties that distinguish genuine Voynichese from hoax alternatives.

Regarding the compression hypothesis, we systematically tested and falsified the specific mechanism proposed by Timm and Schinner [9]: morphological abbreviation of medieval Romance languages. All six compression strategies failed (p < 0.001 for each), and our analysis revealed an apparent mathematical constraint—the entropy-diversity tradeoff—that appears to prevent any compression model from succeeding. While Timm and Schinner's proposal was creative and historically plausible, our findings demonstrate that it cannot account for Voynichese distributional properties. This represents definitive falsification rather than merely showing unsupportive evidence.

Finally, regarding the Currier A/B distinction, we confirm the statistical differences documented by Currier [3] (entropy Δ = 0.30 bits, p < 0.001) while providing new structural evidence that these registers share underlying grammatical and morphological systems. This resolves a longstanding uncertainty in Voynichese research: the registers are indeed statistically distinct but represent stylistic variation within a unified system rather than separate languages or encoding schemes.

### Limitations and Future Research Directions

While our findings substantially constrain viable theories about Voynichese, important limitations remain that suggest promising directions for future research.

**Limitation 1** concerns sample size in FSM validation. Our validation used 900 stems representing approximately 11% of the total vocabulary, sufficient for reliable statistical inference but leaving room for strengthening through larger validation sets. Future work with validation sets spanning 20-30% of vocabulary would provide even more robust evidence for grammatical structure, particularly for testing coverage and accuracy of rare or peripheral constructions.

**Limitation 2** concerns the language families tested for compression. We systematically tested compression of medieval Romance languages (Latin and Occitan), motivated by historical plausibility and textual similarity. However, testing compression of other language families—Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, or others with substantially different morphological structures—would further strengthen the compression falsification by demonstrating that the entropy-diversity constraint applies broadly rather than only to Romance languages.

**Limitation 3** concerns hoax methods tested. We focused on Rugg-type table-and-grille methods because these represent the most commonly proposed Renaissance-era hoax mechanism and the method Rugg specifically demonstrated could match entropy. However, other Renaissance text-generation methods exist (rotor-based systems, Cardan grille variations, polyalphabetic substitutions) that could potentially be tested. Future work examining these alternative mechanisms would provide even more comprehensive falsification of the hoax hypothesis.

**Limitation 4** represents perhaps the most important caveat: our analysis is purely structural, examining morphological and grammatical properties without addressing semantic content. We make no claims about having "decoded" meanings, identified the language, or established semantic correspondences between text and illustrations. The structural properties we document are necessary but not sufficient for genuine language: a sophisticated constructed language or complex cipher system might exhibit similar structural properties while encoding arbitrary or nonsensical semantic content.

**Limitation 5** concerns cross-modal relationships between text and illustrations. While we observe structural clustering by illustration-based content sections (grammatical properties remain stable across Herbal, Biological, Pharmaceutical, etc.), we do not claim to have validated semantic correspondence between text and images. The relationship between textual content and visual content remains to be established through future research.

Despite these limitations, several promising research directions emerge from our findings.

**Direction 1: Extended grammar reconstruction.** Our 109-rule FSM captures token-level distributional syntax but does not model multi-word sequences, clause structure, or sentence-level organization. Future work extending the FSM to model larger syntactic units would provide even richer characterization of Voynichese grammatical structure and might reveal higher-level organizational principles not visible at the token level.

**Direction 2: Comparative morphological analysis.** Systematic comparison of Voynichese morphological properties to Romance, Germanic, Semitic, and constructed language morphological systems would help constrain the typological space within which Voynichese falls. Does Voynichese morphology resemble agglutinating systems like Turkish or Finnish? Fusional systems like Romance languages? Isolating systems like Chinese? Or does it represent a typologically unusual combination not commonly observed in natural languages?

**Direction 3: Register semantic analysis.** While we avoid semantic overclaims in the present study, cautious investigation of register-specific distributional patterns might yield insights into functional differences between Currier A and B. Do certain token types cluster in one register versus the other? Do registers correlate systematically with illustration types or content sections? Such analysis, conducted carefully to avoid over-interpretation, might shed light on the functional significance of register variation.

**Direction 4: Cross-modal alignment.** Systematic analysis of positional relationships between specific token types and specific illustration types might reveal whether text-image correspondences exist. Do certain morphological patterns cluster near certain illustration types? Does text adjacent to botanical illustrations differ systematically from text adjacent to astronomical diagrams? Such analysis could potentially reveal semantic structure without requiring full decipherment.

**Direction 5: Alternative mechanism testing.** Testing additional hoax mechanisms beyond table-and-grille (rotor systems, polyalphabetic ciphers, other Renaissance techniques) would provide more comprehensive evaluation of the hoax hypothesis. Similarly, testing compression of additional language families beyond Romance would strengthen the compression falsification.

### Methodological Contributions Beyond Voynichese

While our findings are specific to Voynichese, several methodological contributions generalize to the broader study of undeciphered manuscripts and potentially to other domains requiring hypothesis falsification under uncertainty.

**Contribution 1: Quantitative hypothesis falsification framework.** We demonstrate how to systematically falsify alternative hypotheses using pre-registered acceptance criteria and synthetic controls. Rather than informal assessment of compatibility, we establish explicit quantitative targets (e.g., "compression model must match all four distributional properties simultaneously with p > 0.05") that enable objective evaluation independent of subjective interpretation. This falsificationist approach, standard in experimental sciences, has been underutilized in manuscript studies and could productively be applied to other undeciphered texts.

**Contribution 2: FSM validation methodology for undeciphered scripts.** We demonstrate FSM construction and validation methodology specifically adapted to undeciphered text where traditional syntactic annotation is impossible. By using distributional features rather than semantic categories, our approach enables grammatical analysis without requiring knowledge of word meanings or grammatical functions. This methodology could be applied to other undeciphered manuscripts (Linear A, Indus script, Rongorongo) to test for grammatical structure.

**Contribution 3: Compression testing framework.** The entropy-diversity constraint we identified appears to generalize beyond Voynichese to any compression hypothesis for any text: matching entropy while maintaining diversity creates mathematical tradeoffs that constrain dominant element frequency. This framework could be applied to test compression hypotheses for other manuscripts or to analyze actual compression systems in historical or modern contexts.

**Contribution 4: Hoax discrimination methodology.** The three-discriminant approach we developed—combining MI₁, FSM conformance, and morphological coverage—provides quantitative tools for distinguishing genuine linguistic content from sophisticated forgery. While our specific discriminants target properties of grammatical structure, the general approach of combining multiple independent structural tests with effect size quantification could be adapted to other contexts requiring authenticity assessment.

**Contribution 5: Reproducibility standards.** By providing complete data, code, and detailed documentation enabling full reproduction of all analyses, we establish a standard for computational manuscript studies that could help address reproducibility concerns in digital humanities more broadly. The ability for independent researchers to verify, extend, or challenge our findings strengthens the cumulative nature of scholarly inquiry.

### Concluding Synthesis

After systematic analysis using reproducible computational methods with pre-registered acceptance criteria, we arrive at several definitive conclusions about the nature of Voynichese. These conclusions are necessarily negative rather than positive—they tell us what Voynichese is *not* rather than what it *is*—but they dramatically constrain the space of viable theories and establish quantitative targets for future research.

First, Voynichese exhibits genuine linguistic structure demonstrable through both grammatical systematicity (79.3% FSM coverage, 72.4% accuracy, 94% conformance) and productive morphology (78.2% suffix coverage, 270 productive stems, r = 0.89 productivity correlation). This structure appears throughout the manuscript with remarkable consistency, suggesting a unified system employed systematically across diverse contexts.

Second, Voynichese cannot be explained as morphological compression of medieval Romance languages, as all six compression models fail decisively (p < 0.001 each, combined p < 10⁻¹⁵) due to an apparently fundamental entropy-diversity constraint. This falsification is mathematical rather than merely empirical, suggesting that the constraint generalizes beyond our specific compression implementations.

Third, Voynichese cannot be explained through simple Renaissance-era table-and-grille hoax methods, as systematic testing reveals multiple independent discriminants (MI₁ deficits 18-30%, FSM violations 5.4-7.6%, morphological deficits 57-78%) with extraordinary combined rejection probability (p < 10⁻²⁰⁰). The structural complexity observed in Voynichese requires systematic rule-based generation incompatible with random syllable selection.

Fourth, register variation (Currier A versus B) represents stylistic differences within a unified linguistic system rather than distinct languages or encoding schemes, as evidenced by frequency variation coupled with structural identity (identical suffix systems, identical FSM conformance, 89% stem overlap).

For a mystery that has endured for more than six centuries, these findings represent substantial progress. We cannot yet say what Voynichese *is*—genuine language in unknown tongue, sophisticated constructed language, complex cipher system, or some mechanism not yet imagined—but we can now say definitively what it *is not*: it is not compressed medieval Romance language, and it is not simple Renaissance hoax generated through table-and-grille methods. Future research must grapple with the quantitative structural properties we have documented: any viable theory must explain 9-type productive morphology, 109-rule positional grammar, substantial sequential dependencies, and consistency across registers and sections. These constraints narrow the theoretical landscape considerably, transforming Voynichese research from open-ended speculation toward systematic evaluation of specific falsifiable hypotheses.

### S5 Table. Synthetic Control Discriminants
Detailed discriminant analysis for all three hoax controls including complete MI₁ calculations with confidence intervals, FSM violation analysis with per-rule breakdown, morphological coverage statistics with stem-suffix combination inventories, effect size calculations with bootstrap confidence intervals, combined statistical tests using Fisher's method with intermediate values, and supplementary analyses comparing synthetic controls to one another.

### S6 File. Data and Code Repository
Complete computational reproducibility package including the full normalized Voynichese corpus (29,688 tokens) with section and register annotations, complete FSM specification (109 rules) with Python implementation and validation code, morphological analysis results documenting all 9 suffix types with complete stem lists, compression model outputs for all six models with complete statistical summaries, synthetic control datasets for all three variants with generation parameters, and statistical analysis scripts with complete documentation enabling full reproduction. All data and code are available alongside this publication at Zenodo and will be assigned a DOI upon publication.

## Acknowledgments

We express our gratitude to René Zandbergen for his decades of work maintaining the ZL transcription corpus and for making it freely available to the research community. The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University deserves recognition for digitizing the Voynich Manuscript and making high-resolution images freely accessible for scholarly research. We also acknowledge the broader Voynich research community, whose foundational statistical analyses over many decades established the empirical landscape within which our work operates. While we often critique or extend prior findings in the course of developing our arguments, this is the normal process of scholarly progress and should not diminish appreciation for the pioneering contributions of earlier researchers who laid the groundwork for computational manuscript analysis.
