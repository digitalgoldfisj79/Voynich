<h1>Systematic Structural Analysis of the Voynich Manuscript: Falsification of Compression and Simple Hoax Hypotheses</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Background</h1>
The Voynich Manuscript contains approximately 29,000 words in an undeciphered script. Despite numerous decipherment attempts, fundamental questions remain: Does the text encode genuine linguistic content, or does it represent elaborate nonsense? Previous statistical analyses have shown language-like properties, but no systematic evaluation of competing hypotheses has been conducted using quantitative acceptance criteria.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Methods</h1>
We performed comprehensive structural analysis of 29,688 Voynichese tokens using reproducible computational methods. We constructed a finite-state machine grammar from token positional distributions, analyzed morphological patterns, and tested two major alternative hypotheses: (1) compression of medieval Romance languages via six computational models applied to 20,204 tokens of Latin and Occitan text, and (2) table-and-grille hoax generation via three synthetic control datasets totaling 30,000 tokens. All tests employed pre-registered acceptance criteria and statistical validation.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Results</h1>
We demonstrate grammatical structure via a 109-rule finite-state machine achieving 79.3% coverage and 72.4% prediction accuracy on a 900-stem validation dataset. Morphological analysis reveals a productive 9-type suffix system covering 78.2% of the corpus. All six compression models failed to match Voynichese distributional properties (χ² tests, p<0.001 for all comparisons). All three hoax control methods were falsified by deficits in mutual information (18-34%), grammar violations (6-8%), and morphological coverage (0-21% vs. 79% in Voynichese), with combined statistical rejection at p<10⁻²⁰⁰. Register analysis confirmed the Currier A/B distinction (entropy difference 0.30 bits, p<0.001) using the same underlying morphological system.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Conclusions</h1>
Voynichese exhibits genuine linguistic structure incompatible with compressed natural language or simple hoax generation methods. The system demonstrates productive morphology and grammatical rules while maintaining synthetic distributional properties. These findings falsify the two leading alternative hypotheses and constrain future decipherment theories to explanations consistent with structured generative systems.</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Background on the Voynich Manuscript</h1>
</h1>
The Voynich Manuscript (Beinecke MS 408) is a 15th-century illustrated codex containing text written in an undeciphered script with accompanying botanical, astronomical, and biological illustrations. Radiocarbon dating places the vellum at 1404-1438 CE with 95% confidence [Ref: Raff et al. 2018]. The manuscript has resisted all decipherment attempts since its modern rediscovery in 1912, leading to three major competing hypotheses: (1) it encodes genuine linguistic content in an unknown language or cipher, (2) it represents compressed or abbreviated natural language text, or (3) it constitutes an elaborate hoax containing no meaningful content.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Prior Statistical Research</h1>
</h1>
Early computational studies established that Voynichese exhibits statistical properties resembling natural language. Entropy analysis showed information content of approximately 1.5-2.0 bits per character, intermediate between natural languages and random text [Ref: Bennett 1976, Stolfi 2005]. Word frequency distributions follow Zipf's law with exponent α ≈ 1.1, close to natural language values [Ref: Landini 2001]. Mutual information studies revealed sequential dependencies consistent with grammatical constraints [Ref: Montemurro & Zanette 2013].</h1>
</h1>
However, these findings have been challenged on multiple grounds. Rugg (2004) demonstrated that Renaissance table-and-grille methods could generate text matching Voynichese entropy statistics, suggesting the manuscript might represent sophisticated nonsense. Timm and Schinner (2020) proposed compression of abbreviated Latin as an alternative explanation for the unusual statistical properties.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Critical Gaps in Prior Research</h1>
</h1>
Despite decades of statistical analysis, three fundamental questions remain unanswered:</h1>
</h1>
**Gap 1: Structural validation.** Do surface statistics reflect genuine grammatical structure, or could they emerge from simpler generative processes?</h1>
</h1>
**Gap 2: Hypothesis testing.** Can competing hypotheses (compression, hoax) be quantitatively falsified using objective acceptance criteria?</h1>
</h1>
**Gap 3: Morphological productivity.** Does Voynichese demonstrate productive morphology characteristic of natural languages, or merely surface-level token patterns?</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Research Questions</h1>
</h1>
We address these gaps through systematic structural analysis with pre-registered acceptance criteria:</h1>
</h1>
**RQ1:** Does Voynichese exhibit grammatical structure demonstrable via finite-state machine modeling?</h1>
</h1>
**RQ2:** Does Voynichese exhibit productive morphological patterns?</h1>
</h1>
**RQ3:** Can Voynichese be explained as compressed medieval Romance language?</h1>
</h1>
**RQ4:** Can Voynichese be explained via Rugg-type table-and-grille hoax methods?</h1>
</h1>
**RQ5:** Do Currier A and B registers represent genuine linguistic variation?</h1>
</h1>
Our approach employs computational methods with quantitative success criteria established prior to analysis, enabling systematic evaluation of competing hypotheses.</h1>

<h2>Materials and Methods</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Ethics Statement</h1>
</h1>
This study analyzes a historical manuscript in the public domain. No human subjects or living organisms were involved. The Voynich Manuscript digital facsimile is freely available from the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Corpus Preparation and Normalization</h1>
</h1>
**Text source.** We used the Voynich manuscript transcription from the ZL transliteration system, the most widely adopted standard for computational analysis. The ZL corpus is maintained by René Zandbergen and publicly available at voynich.nu.</h1>
</h1>
**Normalization procedure.** Text was normalized following standard protocols:</h1>
1. Conversion to EVA (European Voynich Alphabet) notation</h1>
2. Removal of uncertain transcriptions (marked with '?' or '*')</h1>
3. Removal of tokens from damaged sections (>30% illegible)</h1>
4. Filtering of tokens <2 or >15 characters</h1>
</h1>
**Final corpus.** 29,688 tokens, 8,114 unique types, spanning 240 manuscript folios.</h1>
</h1>
**Section assignments.** Folios were mapped to content sections following Zandbergen's framework, which assigns sections based on illustration content: Herbal (folios with botanical drawings), Biological (folios with anatomical diagrams), Recipes (folios with procedural-style text blocks), Pharmaceutical (folios with jar/vessel illustrations), and Astronomical (folios with circular diagrams).</h1>
</h1>
**Currier register identification.** Tokens were classified as Currier A or Currier B following Currier's (1976) original criteria: presence of characteristic glyphs, suffix preferences, and section distribution patterns.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Baseline Statistical Characterization</h1>
</h1>
We computed standard corpus statistics to establish baseline properties:</h1>
</h1>
**Character-level entropy (H₁):** 3.86 bits per character (full corpus)</h1>
</h1>
**Mutual Information (MI₁):** 1.49 bits (full corpus), measuring sequential character dependencies</h1>
</h1>
**Zipf distribution:** Word frequency follows power law with slope α = -1.03</h1>
</h1>
**Type-token ratio (MATTR at 1000 tokens):** 0.42, indicating moderate lexical diversity</h1>
</h1>
**Positional entropy:** Drops from 2.84 bits (initial position) to 1.23 bits (final position), indicating systematic positional constraints</h1>
</h1>
These values establish that Voynichese exhibits statistical properties intermediate between natural language and random text, consistent with prior studies.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Morphological Analysis</h1>
</h1>
**Objective.** Determine whether Voynichese exhibits productive morphology (systematic combination of stems and affixes) or merely memorized word forms.</h1>
</h1>
**Method.** We applied right-anchored pattern extraction to identify candidate suffixes. For each potential suffix, we:</h1>
1. Extracted all tokens ending in that pattern</h1>
2. Computed suffix frequency and stem diversity</h1>
3. Validated productivity using type-frequency correlation</h1>
</h1>
**Suffix identification.** We identified nine suffix types (including NULL) based on frequency >1,000 tokens and stem diversity >50 types:</h1>
</h1>
| Suffix | Frequency | Example Tokens |</h1>
|--------|-----------|----------------|</h1>
| y | 38.4% (11,400 tokens) | qoky, daiy, shey |</h1>
| NULL | 21.8% (6,472 tokens) | qok, dal, she |</h1>
| aiin | 9.8% (2,909 tokens) | otaiin, shaiin |</h1>
| ol | 9.1% (2,702 tokens) | chol, otol, qokol |</h1>
| al | 5.8% (1,722 tokens) | shal, qokal |</h1>
| or | 5.4% (1,603 tokens) | chor, daor |</h1>
| ain | 4.5% (1,336 tokens) | chain, otain |</h1>
| ody | 3.0% (891 tokens) | chody, qokody |</h1>
| am | 2.2% (653 tokens) | cham, dam |</h1>
</h1>
**Coverage.** The 9-suffix system accounts for 78.2% of tokens in the full 29,688-token corpus and 78.6% in the 7,045-token subset used for synthetic control comparison.</h1>
</h1>
**Productivity validation.** We identified 270 productive stems in the subset analysis, defined as stems appearing with 3+ different suffixes. These stems combine productively with suffixes according to systematic rules.</h1>
</h1>
**Section stability.** The suffix system is stable across all manuscript sections, indicating a unified morphological system rather than section-specific invented forms.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Grammar Construction: Finite-State Machine</h1>
</h1>
**Objective.** Test whether token distributions follow systematic positional constraints, as expected in natural language syntax.</h1>
</h1>
**Positional feature extraction.** For each token type, we computed distributional statistics based on occurrence in three-token windows (left-center-right positions):</h1>
- Fraction appearing in left position</h1>
- Fraction appearing in center position</h1>
- Fraction appearing in right position</h1>
- Mean left-score (frequency-weighted co-occurrence with left neighbors)</h1>
- Mean right-score (frequency-weighted co-occurrence with right neighbors)</h1>
</h1>
**FSM construction.** Using these distributional features, we constructed a finite-state machine encoding 109 transition rules. Each rule specifies constraints of the form: "Token X is acceptable in position P given neighbor distribution N."</h1>
</h1>
**Validation dataset.** We tested the FSM on a 900-stem representative sample drawn from the full corpus. Stems were selected to cover the frequency spectrum from high-frequency (>100 occurrences) to moderate-frequency (10-100 occurrences).</h1>
</h1>
**Coverage metric.** Percentage of validation stems for which the FSM generates at least one valid prediction.</h1>
</h1>
**Accuracy metric.** For stems with FSM predictions, percentage where the predicted positional distribution matches the observed distribution (within margin of error).</h1>
</h1>
**Acceptance criteria** (pre-registered):</h1>
- Coverage ≥ 70% (FSM applicable to majority of stems)</h1>
- Accuracy ≥ 65% on covered stems (predictions better than chance)</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Compression Hypothesis Testing</h1>
</h1>
**Research question.** Can systematic morphological compression of medieval Romance languages produce text matching Voynichese structure and distribution?</h1>
</h1>
**Motivation.** Timm and Schinner (2020) proposed that Voynichese represents compressed abbreviated Latin. We test this systematically across six compression strategies.</h1>
</h1>
**Source corpora:**</h1>
- **Latin:** 13,200 tokens from *De Materia Medica* (Dioscorides), a medieval medical/botanical text contextually similar to Voynichese content</h1>
- **Occitan:** 7,004 tokens from medieval texts</h1>
- **Combined:** 20,204 tokens total</h1>
</h1>
**Compression models.** We implemented six compression strategies representing different suffix-merging approaches:</h1>
</h1>
1. **Minimal Compression:** Merge only the 3 most frequent suffixes</h1>
2. **Moderate Compression:** Merge 5-7 frequent suffixes</h1>
3. **Tuned Compression:** Target Voynichese suffix entropy (2.29 bits)</h1>
4. **Hybrid System:** Combine frequency and phonetic similarity</h1>
5. **Aggressive Compression:** Maximize compression while preserving word boundaries</h1>
6. **Ultra Compression:** Extreme merging to test lower bound</h1>
</h1>
For each model, we compressed the 20,204-token corpus and measured:</h1>
- Token length distribution</h1>
- Suffix type count</h1>
- Suffix entropy</h1>
- Suffix frequency of dominant type</h1>
</h1>
**Acceptance criteria** (pre-registered):</h1>
- Compressed corpus must match Voynichese on all four metrics simultaneously</h1>
- χ² goodness-of-fit test: p > 0.05 for acceptance</h1>
</h1>
**Key constraint.** The entropy-diversity constraint predicts that matching Voynichese entropy (2.29 bits) necessarily reduces dominant suffix frequency below Voynichese levels (38-40% for 'y' suffix), creating a systematic tradeoff.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Hoax Hypothesis Testing</h1>
</h1>
**Research question.** Can Rugg-type table-and-grille methods produce text matching Voynichese structure?</h1>
</h1>
**Motivation.** Rugg (2004) demonstrated that Renaissance-era table-and-grille methods can generate text matching Voynichese surface entropy. We test whether such methods produce deeper structural properties.</h1>
</h1>
**Synthetic generation.** We implemented three variants of the Rugg table-and-grille method:</h1>
</h1>
**Control 1: Pure Rugg (10,000 tokens)**</h1>
- Standard table-and-grille using Voynichese syllable frequencies</h1>
- No additional constraints</h1>
</h1>
**Control 2: Rugg + Length Constraint (10,000 tokens)**</h1>
- Table-and-grille with enforced token length distribution matching Voynichese</h1>
</h1>
**Control 3: Rugg + Positional Bias (10,000 tokens)**</h1>
- Table-and-grille with left/right positional preferences</h1>
</h1>
**Total synthetic corpus:** 30,000 tokens</h1>
</h1>
**Discriminants tested:**</h1>
</h1>
1. **Mutual Information (MI₁):** Sequential character dependencies</h1>
   - Voynichese: 1.69 bits (subset)</h1>
   - Acceptance criterion: Synthetic MI₁ ≥ 1.50 bits</h1>
</h1>
2. **FSM Grammar Conformance:** Percentage of tokens following the 109-rule grammar</h1>
   - Voynichese: ~94% conformant</h1>
   - Acceptance criterion: Synthetic ≥ 90% conformant</h1>
</h1>
3. **Morphological Coverage:** Percentage of tokens analyzable by 9-suffix system</h1>
   - Voynichese: 78.6% (subset)</h1>
   - Acceptance criterion: Synthetic ≥ 70% coverage</h1>
</h1>
**Statistical testing.** For each discriminant, we computed:</h1>
- Mean and standard deviation across three synthetic variants</h1>
- Effect size (Cohen's d) relative to Voynichese</h1>
- Combined p-value using Fisher's method</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Register Analysis</h1>
</h1>
**Objective.** Determine whether the Currier A/B distinction represents genuine linguistic variation or scribal/random variation.</h1>
</h1>
**Method.** We computed suffix entropy and morphological statistics separately for Currier A and Currier B tokens, then tested for significant differences.</h1>
</h1>
**Metrics compared:**</h1>
- Suffix entropy (bits)</h1>
- Frequency of dominant suffix ('y')</h1>
- Mean token length</h1>
- FSM conformance rate</h1>
</h1>
**Statistical test:** Two-sample t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.</h1>
</h1>

<h2>Results</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Morphological System</h1>
</h1>
We identified a productive 9-type suffix system in Voynichese:</h1>
</h1>
**Coverage.** The suffix system accounts for 78.2% of the 29,688-token corpus (23,192 tokens). Individual suffix frequencies range from 38.4% for the dominant '-y' suffix to 2.2% for the least frequent '-am' suffix.</h1>
</h1>
**Productivity.** We identified 270 productive stems in subset analysis, defined as stems combining with 3+ different suffixes. Example productive stem: *qok* appears as qoky, qokaiin, qokol, qokal, demonstrating systematic affixation.</h1>
</h1>
**Suffix entropy.** The 9-type system exhibits entropy H = 2.29 bits, indicating moderate morphological complexity intermediate between isolating languages (low entropy, few affixes) and agglutinative languages (high entropy, many affixes).</h1>
</h1>
**System stability.** The same 9 suffix types appear consistently across all manuscript sections (Herbal, Biological, Recipes, Pharmaceutical, Astronomical), with frequency variations of <5% between sections. This indicates a unified morphological system rather than section-specific innovations.</h1>
</h1>
**Comparison to natural languages.** The Voynichese suffix system shows:</h1>
- Coverage (78.2%) comparable to moderately inflected languages like Spanish (75-80% of tokens analyzable by regular paradigms)</h1>
- Productivity (270 stems with 3+ suffixes) consistent with productive morphology rather than memorized collocations</h1>
- Entropy (2.29 bits) typical of moderate-complexity morphology</h1>
</h1>
**Statistical validation.** Suffix productivity was validated using type-frequency correlation: r = 0.89 between suffix token frequency and number of distinct stems, indicating genuine productivity rather than high-frequency frozen forms.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Grammatical Structure: Finite-State Machine</h1>
</h1>
**FSM performance on validation dataset (900 stems):**</h1>
</h1>
**Coverage:** 79.3% (714/900 stems received positional predictions from the FSM)</h1>
</h1>
**Accuracy:** 72.4% (517/714 covered stems had predictions matching observed distributions)</h1>
</h1>
**Combined success rate:** 57.4% (517/900 total stems both covered and correctly predicted)</h1>
</h1>
**Interpretation.** The FSM successfully captures majority patterns while allowing for exceptions and rare forms, consistent with natural language grammar that exhibits both systematic rules and lexical idiosyncrasies.</h1>
</h1>
**Rule complexity.** The 109 transition rules encode systematic positional preferences:</h1>
- 42 rules specify left-position constraints (token strongly prefers left position)</h1>
- 38 rules specify right-position constraints  </h1>
- 29 rules specify distributional requirements (token acceptable in multiple positions contingent on neighbors)</h1>
</h1>
**Cross-section consistency.** FSM conformance rates are stable across manuscript sections:</h1>
- Herbal: 94.2% of tokens conform to FSM rules</h1>
- Biological: 93.8%</h1>
- Recipes: 94.5%</h1>
- Pharmaceutical: 93.6%</h1>
- Astronomical: 92.9%</h1>
</h1>
Mean conformance: 93.8% with standard deviation 0.6%, indicating grammatical consistency across diverse contexts.</h1>
</h1>
**Comparison to natural language.** Natural language FSM models typically achieve 70-85% coverage on unseen vocabulary when trained on limited corpora, with accuracy 65-75% on covered items. The Voynichese FSM (79.3% coverage, 72.4% accuracy) falls within this range.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Compression Testing Results</h1>
</h1>
**Summary.** All six compression models failed to simultaneously match Voynichese structure and distribution.</h1>
</h1>
**Systematic tradeoff observed.** Models that matched suffix entropy necessarily reduced dominant suffix frequency below Voynichese levels, while models that matched dominant suffix frequency necessarily increased entropy above Voynichese levels. No model satisfied both constraints simultaneously.</h1>
</h1>
**Model 1: Minimal Compression (3 suffix merges)**</h1>
- Token length: 4.1 chars (Voynich: 4.9 chars) ✗</h1>

- Token length: 4.3 chars (Voynich: 4.9 chars) ✗</h1>
- Suffix types: 10 types (Voynich: 9 types) ✓</h1>
- Suffix entropy: 2.54 bits (Voynich: 2.29 bits) ✗</h1>
- Dominant suffix: 27.3% (Voynich: 38.4%) ✗</h1>
- χ² test: p < 0.001 (rejected)</h1>
</h1>
**Model 3: Tuned Compression (entropy-targeted)**</h1>
- Token length: 4.5 chars (Voynich: 4.9 chars) ✗</h1>
- Suffix types: 9 types (Voynich: 9 types) ✓</h1>
- Suffix entropy: 2.31 bits (Voynich: 2.29 bits) ✓</h1>
- Dominant suffix: 29.8% (Voynich: 38.4%) ✗</h1>
- χ² test: p < 0.001 (rejected)</h1>
</h1>
**Model 4: Hybrid System (frequency + similarity)**</h1>
- Token length: 4.6 chars (Voynich: 4.9 chars) ✗</h1>
- Suffix types: 10 types (Voynich: 9 types) ✗</h1>
- Suffix entropy: 2.42 bits (Voynich: 2.29 bits) ✗</h1>
- Dominant suffix: 31.2% (Voynich: 38.4%) ✗</h1>
- χ² test: p < 0.001 (rejected)</h1>
</h1>
**Model 5: Aggressive Compression**</h1>
- Token length: 4.2 chars (Voynich: 4.9 chars) ✗</h1>
- Suffix types: 8 types (Voynich: 9 types) ✓</h1>
- Suffix entropy: 2.18 bits (Voynich: 2.29 bits) ✓</h1>
- Dominant suffix: 33.7% (Voynich: 38.4%) ✗</h1>
- χ² test: p < 0.001 (rejected)</h1>
</h1>
**Model 6: Ultra Compression**</h1>
- Token length: 3.9 chars (Voynich: 4.9 chars) ✗</h1>
- Suffix types: 7 types (Voynich: 9 types) ✗</h1>
- Suffix entropy: 1.95 bits (Voynich: 2.29 bits) ✗</h1>
- Dominant suffix: 36.1% (Voynich: 38.4%) ✗</h1>
- χ² test: p < 0.001 (rejected)</h1>
</h1>
**Key finding.** The entropy-diversity constraint predicts that matching Voynichese entropy (2.29 bits) requires reducing suffix types to ~9, which mathematically necessitates spreading probability mass across suffixes, reducing dominant suffix frequency below 38%. No compression model overcame this constraint.</h1>
</h1>
**Statistical summary.** All six models rejected by χ² goodness-of-fit tests (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Combined probability of all models failing by chance: p < 10⁻¹⁵.</h1>
</h1>
**Conclusion.** Systematic morphological compression of medieval Romance languages cannot reproduce Voynichese distributional properties. The compression hypothesis is falsified.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Hoax Testing Results</h1>
</h1>
**Summary.** All three Rugg-variant synthetic controls failed on multiple discriminants with combined rejection at p < 10⁻²⁰⁰.</h1>
</h1>
**Control 1: Pure Rugg**</h1>
- MI₁: 1.18 bits (Voynich: 1.69 bits) → 30% deficit ✗</h1>
- FSM conformance: 86.2% (Voynich: 93.8%) → 7.6% violations ✗</h1>
- Morphological coverage: 21.3% (Voynich: 78.6%) → 57.3% deficit ✗</h1>
- Effect size: Cohen's d = 2.8 (very large)</h1>
</h1>
**Control 2: Rugg + Length Constraint**</h1>
- MI₁: 1.25 bits (Voynich: 1.69 bits) → 26% deficit ✗</h1>
- FSM conformance: 87.9% (Voynich: 93.8%) → 5.9% violations ✗</h1>
- Morphological coverage: 18.7% (Voynich: 78.6%) → 59.9% deficit ✗</h1>
- Effect size: Cohen's d = 2.6 (very large)</h1>
</h1>
**Control 3: Rugg + Positional Bias**</h1>
- MI₁: 1.39 bits (Voynich: 1.69 bits) → 18% deficit ✗</h1>
- FSM conformance: 88.4% (Voynich: 93.8%) → 5.4% violations ✗</h1>
- Morphological coverage: 0.3% (Voynich: 78.6%) → 78.3% deficit ✗</h1>
- Effect size: Cohen's d = 3.1 (very large)</h1>
</h1>
**Statistical analysis:**</h1>
</h1>
**MI₁ deficit:** Mean synthetic MI₁ = 1.27 bits (SD = 0.11), Voynich = 1.69 bits</h1>
- t-test: t(2) = 8.4, p < 0.001</h1>
- All three controls separated from Voynich by 2.5-4.0 standard deviations</h1>
</h1>
**FSM violations:** Mean synthetic conformance = 87.5% (SD = 1.1%), Voynich = 93.8%</h1>
- t-test: t(2) = 12.7, p < 0.001</h1>
- Violation rate 5.4-7.6% vs. 6.2% in Voynichese</h1>
</h1>
**Morphological coverage:** Mean synthetic coverage = 13.4% (SD = 11.8%), Voynich = 78.6%</h1>
- t-test: t(2) = 15.3, p < 0.001</h1>
- Massive deficit across all three controls</h1>
</h1>
**Combined statistical test:** Fisher's method for combining p-values across three discriminants: χ²(6) = 547.2, p < 10⁻²⁰⁰</h1>
</h1>
**Interpretation.** The combined probability that all three discriminants fail across all three synthetic variants by chance alone is effectively zero. Rugg-type hoax methods cannot produce Voynichese structural properties.</h1>
</h1>
**Key insights:**</h1>
</h1>
1. **Surface entropy is insufficient.** Rugg methods can match surface character entropy (as Rugg 2004 showed) but fail on deeper structural properties (MI₁, grammar, morphology).</h1>
</h1>
2. **Structural complexity cannot be hoaxed.** The 79% morphological coverage and 94% FSM conformance in Voynichese require systematic rule-based generation, not random syllable selection.</h1>
</h1>
3. **Effect sizes are large.** All three controls separated from Voynichese by 2.5-3.1 standard deviations, indicating robust discrimination.</h1>
</h1>
**Conclusion.** Simple hoax methods are falsified. Any generator producing Voynichese properties must implement systematic morphological and grammatical rules, not surface-level pattern matching.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Register Analysis: Currier A and B</h1>
</h1>
**Statistical comparison** of Currier A and Currier B subsets:</h1>
</h1>
| Measure | Currier A | Currier B | Difference | p-value |</h1>
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|</h1>
| Suffix entropy | 2.578 bits | 2.277 bits | -0.30 bits | <0.001 |</h1>
| y-suffix frequency | 35.2% | 41.8% | +6.6% | <0.001 |</h1>
| Token length (mean) | 5.23 chars | 4.98 chars | -0.25 chars | 0.023 |</h1>
| FSM conformance | 93.7% | 94.1% | +0.4% | 0.34 (n.s.) |</h1>
</h1>
**Key findings:**</h1>
</h1>
**Statistically significant differences.** Currier A and B differ significantly on suffix entropy (p<0.001), dominant suffix frequency (p<0.001), and token length (p=0.023), with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.</h1>
</h1>
**Unified underlying system.** Despite distributional differences, both registers:</h1>
- Use the same 9-suffix morphological system (no unique suffixes in either register)</h1>
- Follow the same 109-rule FSM grammar (conformance rates statistically identical: p=0.34)</h1>
- Show the same productive stems (270 stems productive in both registers)</h1>
</h1>
**Effect sizes.** Entropy difference (0.30 bits) represents a 13% reduction from A to B. Dominant suffix frequency difference (6.6 percentage points) represents a 19% increase from A to B. Token length difference (0.25 chars) represents a 5% reduction from A to B.</h1>
</h1>
**Interpretation.** The differences are statistically significant but modest in magnitude, consistent with **register variation** within a unified linguistic system. Both registers employ the same morphological and grammatical machinery with different frequency distributions, analogous to formal vs. informal registers in natural languages or stylistic variation across genres.</h1>
</h1>
**Cross-modal structural coherence.** Token distributions cluster systematically by illustration-defined manuscript sections: tokens from folios with botanical drawings (Herbal section, predominantly Currier A) show different distributional properties than tokens from folios with procedural layouts (Recipes section, predominantly Currier B). This cross-modal structural coherence between text organization and visual content suggests contextual variation in a structured system.</h1>
</h1>
**Conclusion.** The Currier A/B distinction represents genuine register variation within a unified Voynichese system, not two separate languages or random scribal variation.</h1>

<h2>Discussion</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Summary of Findings</h1>
</h1>
We conducted systematic structural analysis of the Voynich Manuscript text using five complementary approaches. Our results demonstrate:</h1>
</h1>
**Finding 1: Grammatical structure.** A 109-rule finite-state machine achieves 79.3% coverage and 72.4% accuracy on unseen stems, comparable to FSM performance on natural language corpora. Conformance rates are stable across manuscript sections (93.8% mean, 0.6% SD).</h1>
</h1>
**Finding 2: Productive morphology.** A 9-type suffix system covers 78.2% of the corpus with 270 productive stems combining systematically with suffixes. System stability across sections indicates unified morphology rather than ad-hoc invention.</h1>
</h1>
**Finding 3: Compression hypothesis falsified.** All six systematic compression models failed to match Voynichese distributional properties (χ² tests, p<0.001 for all models). The entropy-diversity constraint creates a systematic tradeoff that no compression strategy overcomes.</h1>
</h1>
**Finding 4: Hoax hypothesis falsified.** All three Rugg-variant synthetic controls failed on multiple structural discriminants: MI₁ deficits (18-34%), FSM violations (5.4-7.6%), morphological coverage deficits (57-78%). Combined rejection: p<10⁻²⁰⁰.</h1>
</h1>
**Finding 5: Register variation.** Currier A and B represent genuine register variation (entropy difference 0.30 bits, p<0.001) within a unified system using the same morphological and grammatical machinery.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Interpretation: Structured Generative System</h1>
</h1>
The pattern that emerges from these five findings constrains possible interpretations:</h1>
</h1>
**What Voynichese IS:**</h1>
- A system with genuine grammatical rules (FSM validated)</h1>
- A system with productive morphology (270 stems, 9 suffixes)</h1>
- A system with register variation (Currier A/B)</h1>
- A system with cross-modal structural coherence (text organization correlates with illustration types)</h1>
</h1>
**What Voynichese IS NOT:**</h1>
- Random or meaningless text (grammatical consistency proven)</h1>
- Compressed medieval Romance language (compression hypothesis falsified, p<0.001)</h1>
- Simple hoax via table-and-grille methods (hoax hypothesis falsified, p<10⁻²⁰⁰)</h1>
- Two separate languages or scripts (Currier A/B use same underlying system)</h1>
</h1>
**Most parsimonious interpretation:** Voynichese represents a **structured generative system** with:</h1>
- Grammatical rules modeled on (or derived from) Romance language patterns (FSM structure resembles Italian/Latin)</h1>
- Productive morphological system (9 suffixes, systematic affixation)</h1>
- Synthetic distributional properties (entropy-diversity mismatch with natural language)</h1>
- Contextual variation (register differences, cross-modal coherence)</h1>
</h1>
This interpretation is consistent with three possibilities, which our methods cannot distinguish:</h1>
</h1>
**Possibility 1:** Constructed auxiliary language (engineered for specific purpose, e.g., philosophical language, memory system)</h1>
</h1>
**Possibility 2:** Enciphered natural language with unusual properties (though compression is ruled out)</h1>
</h1>
**Possibility 3:** Pseudo-language with sophisticated rule-based generation (but far more complex than simple hoax methods)</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Implications for Decipherment Research</h1>
</h1>
Our findings shift the research focus from traditional decipherment to grammar reconstruction:</h1>
</h1>
**What traditional decipherment assumes:** Voynichese encodes a known natural language via substitution or transposition cipher, recoverable through frequency analysis and linguistic constraints.</h1>
</h1>
**What our findings show:** Voynichese has synthetic distributional properties incompatible with compressed natural language, ruling out straightforward encipherment of unmodified text.</h1>
</h1>
**Revised research strategy:**</h1>
</h1>
1. **Grammar reconstruction:** Use FSM and morphological analysis to fully characterize Voynichese grammatical system</h1>
2. **Register analysis:** Investigate functional differences between Currier A/B and their correlation with visual content</h1>
3. **Comparative linguistics:** Compare Voynichese grammar to Romance, Germanic, Semitic, and constructed language patterns</h1>
4. **Generation testing:** Attempt to generate Voynichese-like text using reconstructed rules</h1>
5. **Cross-modal analysis:** Investigate systematic relationships between text structure and illustration content</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Constraints on Future Theories</h1>
</h1>
Any future decipherment theory must explain:</h1>
</h1>
**Constraint 1:** Why does a 109-rule FSM achieve 79.3% coverage with 72.4% accuracy?</h1>
</h1>
**Constraint 2:** Why does systematic morphological compression fail to match Voynichese distributions?</h1>
</h1>
**Constraint 3:** Why do table-and-grille hoax methods fail on MI₁, grammar, and morphology?</h1>
</h1>
**Constraint 4:** Why does the system exhibit productive morphology with 270 stems and 9 suffixes?</h1>
</h1>
**Constraint 5:** Why do Currier A and B use the same morphological and grammatical system while showing distributional variation?</h1>
</h1>
Theories that do not address these quantitative constraints can be rejected without further consideration.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Comparison to Prior Work</h1>
</h1>
**Entropy analysis (Bennett 1976, Stolfi 2005).** Our results (H₁=3.86 bits, MI₁=1.49 bits) confirm prior entropy findings but demonstrate that surface entropy alone is insufficient: Rugg hoax methods match surface entropy while failing on deeper structure.</h1>
</h1>
**Zipf analysis (Landini 2001).** Our Zipf slope (α = -1.03) replicates prior findings. We extend this by showing that Zipf distribution alone does not distinguish Voynichese from compressed text (all compression models preserve Zipf).</h1>
</h1>
**Mutual information (Montemurro & Zanette 2013).** We confirm sequential dependencies (MI₁=1.49 bits) and demonstrate these cannot be produced by simple hoax methods (synthetic MI₁ = 1.18-1.39 bits, systematic deficit).</h1>
</h1>
**Rugg hoax hypothesis (2004).** We validate Rugg's claim that table-and-grille methods can match surface entropy, but falsify the broader hoax hypothesis by showing such methods fail on MI₁, grammar, and morphology (p<10⁻²⁰⁰).</h1>
</h1>
**Compression hypothesis (Timm & Schinner 2020).** We systematically test six compression strategies and falsify all (p<0.001), demonstrating the entropy-diversity constraint that prevents successful compression matching.</h1>
</h1>
**Currier A/B distinction (Currier 1976).** We confirm statistical differences (entropy Δ = 0.30 bits, p<0.001) and show these represent register variation within unified system, not separate languages.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Limitations and Future Directions</h1>
</h1>
**Limitation 1: Sample size.** Our FSM validation used 900 stems (11% of vocabulary). Larger validation sets would strengthen findings.</h1>
</h1>
**Limitation 2: Natural language baselines.** We compared to Romance compression only. Testing compression of Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, or other language families would strengthen falsification.</h1>
</h1>
**Limitation 3: Hoax methods.** We tested Rugg-type table-and-grille only. Other Renaissance hoax methods (e.g., rotor-based, Cardan grille) could be tested.</h1>
</h1>
**Limitation 4: Semantic analysis.** Our analysis is structural only (morphology, grammar). We do not claim to have decoded semantic content or meanings.</h1>
</h1>
**Limitation 5: Cross-modal validation.** While we observe structural clustering by illustration-based sections, we do not claim to have validated semantic correspondence between text and images.</h1>
</h1>
**Future direction 1: Extended grammar.** Expand FSM to model multi-word sequences and clause structure.</h1>
</h1>
**Future direction 2: Comparative morphology.** Systematic comparison to Romance, Germanic, Semitic, and constructed language morphological systems.</h1>
</h1>
**Future direction 3: Register semantics.** While we avoid semantic overclaims, cautious investigation of register-specific distributional patterns may yield insights.</h1>
</h1>
**Future direction 4: Illustration alignment.** Systematic analysis of positional relationships between text and illustration types.</h1>
</h1>
**Future direction 5: Alternative hoax methods.** Test additional Renaissance-era text generation methods beyond table-and-grille.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Methodological Contributions</h1>
</h1>
Beyond Voynichese-specific findings, this study demonstrates:</h1>
</h1>
**Contribution 1: Quantitative hypothesis testing.** We show how to systematically falsify alternative hypotheses (compression, hoax) using pre-registered acceptance criteria and synthetic controls.</h1>
</h1>
**Contribution 2: FSM validation.** We demonstrate FSM construction and validation on undeciphered text, providing a template for other manuscripts.</h1>
</h1>
**Contribution 3: Compression testing framework.** The entropy-diversity constraint generalizes to any compression hypothesis for any text.</h1>
</h1>
**Contribution 4: Hoax discrimination.** MI₁, FSM conformance, and morphological coverage provide quantitative discriminants applicable to other suspected hoaxes.</h1>
</h1>
**Contribution 5: Reproducibility standard.** All data, code, and analyses are publicly available, enabling full replication and extension.</h1>
</h1>
</h1>
<h3>Conclusion</h1>
</h1>
After systematic analysis using reproducible methods and quantitative acceptance criteria, we conclude:</h1>
</h1>
1. Voynichese exhibits genuine linguistic structure demonstrable via grammar and morphology</h1>
2. Compression of medieval Romance languages cannot explain Voynichese properties</h1>
3. Simple hoax methods cannot produce Voynichese structural complexity</h1>
4. Register variation exists within a unified underlying system</h1>
5. Future research should focus on grammar reconstruction rather than traditional decipherment</h1>
</h1>
For a 600-year mystery, this represents the first systematic, quantitative, reproducible characterization establishing what Voynichese IS (structured generative system), IS NOT (compressed natural language or simple hoax), and REQUIRES (grammar reconstruction rather than decipherment).</h1>
