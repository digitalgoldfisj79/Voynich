================================================================================
3. STATISTICAL VALIDATION
================================================================================

3.1 BASELINE COMPARISON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test: Does Phase 69 LEFT bias differ from random (50/50)?

  H0: LEFT prediction rate = 50%
  Observed: 58.7%
  Expected: 50.0%
  Difference: 8.7 percentage points
  p-value: 0.000000
  Z-score: 57.99

  Result: ✓✓✓ HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT (p < 0.001)

Interpretation: Phase 69 rules contain genuine morphological signal,
not explainable by random character patterns.

3.2 CROSS-VALIDATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test: Do rules generalize to held-out data?

80/20 Train/Test Split:
  Training set: 20,058 tokens
  Test set:     5,015 tokens

Performance:
  Coverage:   83.9% (train) → 84.6% (test)
  LEFT rate:  59.0% (train) → 57.6% (test)

  Coverage difference: 0.7 percentage points
  LEFT rate difference: 1.4 percentage points

  Result: ✓ EXCELLENT GENERALIZATION (< 2% difference)

Interpretation: Rules are not overfit and generalize reliably
to unseen Voynichese text.

================================================================================
5. RELATIONSHIP TO MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Phase 69 vs PhaseM Comparison:

Phase 69 (Character-level):
  - 109 rules for character patterns
  - Purpose: Predict LEFT/RIGHT morphological axis
  - Method: Pattern matching on character sequences
  - 15 'suffix' rules = character patterns (h, ch, che)

PhaseM (Morphological-level):
  - 8 morphological suffixes
  - Purpose: Document morpheme boundaries
  - Method: Token - Stem extraction
  - Suffixes = morphemes (y, aiin, ol, al, etc.)

Relationship: COMPLEMENTARY, NOT CONTRADICTORY
  - Phase 69: Predicts morphological class from characters
  - PhaseM: Documents actual morphological units
  - Both operate on same underlying linguistic structure
